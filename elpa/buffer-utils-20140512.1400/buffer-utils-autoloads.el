This macro saves the buffer order, executes BODY, then restores
the saved order.  The return value is the last form in BODY.

The buffer order is also restored if BODY exits nonlocally.

Note: BODY should not add or remove buffers, but a graceful
recovery will be attempted if that does occur.

\"Forgetting\" refers to window WIN's memory of what it has
