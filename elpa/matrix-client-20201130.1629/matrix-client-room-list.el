  ;; NOTE: From Emacs docs:

  ;; This buffer-local variable specifies the entries displayed in the
  ;; Tabulated List buffer.  Its value should be either a list, or a
  ;; function.
  ;;
  ;; If the value is a list, each list element corresponds to one entry,
  ;; and should have the form ‚Äò(ID CONTENTS)‚Äô, where
  ;;
  ;; ‚Ä¢ ID is either ‚Äònil‚Äô, or a Lisp object that identifies the
  ;; entry.  If the latter, the cursor stays on the same entry when
  ;; re-sorting entries.  Comparison is done with ‚Äòequal‚Äô.
  ;;
  ;; ‚Ä¢ CONTENTS is a vector with the same number of elements as
  ;; ‚Äòtabulated-list-format‚Äô.  Each vector element is either a
  ;;  string, which is inserted into the buffer as-is, or a list
  ;;  ‚Äò(LABEL . PROPERTIES)‚Äô, which means to insert a text button by
  ;;   calling ‚Äòinsert-text-button‚Äô with LABEL and PROPERTIES as
  ;;   arguments (*note Making Buttons::).
  ;;
  ;;   There should be no newlines in any of these strings.
