;;; Commentary:

;; NOTE: This is a WIP.

;; This provides a Bufler configuration for Matrix.  It needs more
;; work to not interfere with the main Bufler config; ideally there
;; should be a `matrix-bufler' command that would open a Bufler window
;; with its own configuration.  Shouldn't be too hard, but it might
;; need a few tweaks to Bufler to make easier.

;; For Bufler, see <https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el>.
