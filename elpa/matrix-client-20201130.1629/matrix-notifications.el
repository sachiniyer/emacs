;; FIXME: This system is flexible, but a bit complicated and
;; redundant, e.g. there should be a more central dispatch function
;; that dispatches only to the appropriate handlers, rather than
;; having each handler decide what to do by calling `-notify-p'
;; itself.  Or, the dispatcher could pass the result of `-notify-p' to
;; each handler so the value could be computed only once.

;; TODO: Factor out code from here and -room.el that's duplicated/modified here.
