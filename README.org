* Emacs Config

** Why transition from Vanilla to Doom
I personally had used Vanilla Emacs for 5 years (currently a quarter of my
life). I put a lot of work into my config, and learnt a lot of lisp along the
way. That config will always have a special place in my heart.

However, I realized that I will never be able to make anything nearly as good
and maintained as doom emacs. There was no point in trying to recreate pretty
much everything that was already created in doom emacs (the functionality
between my config and doom is surprisingly similar), and so I realized that it
just made a lot more sense to do the switch. It eventually happened after my
linter failed for the last time, and in the middle of my work I took two hours
and made the switch.

** My config
My config does not do too much special. I use EXWM (which doom's fast loading
times make easier). There will probably be more added later for my email
configuration and all.
