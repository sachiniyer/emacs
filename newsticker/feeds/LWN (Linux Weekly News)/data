      The kernel project has a strong focus on not breaking user-space
applications; if something works with a given kernel release, it should
continue to work with subsequent releases.  So it may be discouraging to
read the lengthy exposition on an apparent user-space API break in <a
href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/837034/\">the announcement</a> for the systemd 247-rc2
release.  Changes to udev configuration files will be needed to keep
systems working, but the
systemd project claims that it \"<span>is not [the] fault of systemd or udev, but
caused by an incompatible kernel change that happened back in Linux
4.12</span>\".  It seems like an appropriate time to look at what happened,
how administrators need to respond, and whether anything can be done to
avoid this kind of thing from happening again.
