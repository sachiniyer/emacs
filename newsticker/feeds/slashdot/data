The Verge follows up:
The TL;DR is that yes, Norton does install a crypto miner with its software, without making that clear in the initial setup process. But it isn't going to do anything unless you specifically opt in, so it's not a situation where you'll install the security suite and instantly start seeing your computer lag as it crunches crypto in the background.
A NortonLifeLock spokesperson also told The Verge in an email that you can completely remove NCrypt.exe by temporarily turning off Norton's tamper protection feature, and then deleting the executable. We confirmed that ourselves, and it could be good news for anyone worried about Norton remotely activating the feature.
But Krebs reports the product has drawn some bad reactions &mdash; and not just because Norton is keeping 15% of the currencies mined:
[M]any Norton users complain the mining program is difficult to remove, and reactions from longtime customers have ranged from unease and disbelief to, \"Dude, where's my crypto...?\"
According to the FAQ posted on its site, \"Norton Crypto\" will mine Ethereum cryptocurrency while the customer's computer is idle. The FAQ also says Norton Crypto will only run on systems that meet certain hardware and software requirements (such as an NVIDIA graphics card with at least 6 GB of memory). \"Norton creates a secure digital Ethereum wallet for each user,\" the FAQ reads. \"The key to the wallet is encrypted and stored securely in the cloud. Only you have access to the wallet.\" NortonLifeLock began offering the mining service in July 2021...
[M]any users have reported difficulty removing the mining program.
From reading user posts on the Norton Crypto community forum, it seems some longtime Norton customers were horrified at the prospect of their antivirus product installing coin-mining software, regardless of whether the mining service was turned off by default. \"How on Earth could anyone at Norton think that adding crypto mining within a security product would be a good thing?,\" reads a Dec. 28 thread titled \"Absolutely furious.\"
\"Norton should be DETECTING and killing off crypto mining hijacking, not installing their own,\" the post reads....
\"Norton is pretty much amplifying energy consumption worldwide, costing their customers more in electricity use than the customer makes on the mining, yet allowing Norton to make a ton of profit,\" tweeted security researcher Chris Vickery. \"It's disgusting, gross, and brand-suicide.\"
Then there's the matter of getting paid.... \"Transfers of cryptocurrencies may result in transaction fees (also known as \"gas\" fees) paid to the users of the cryptocurrency blockchain network who process the transaction,\" the FAQ explains... Which might explain why so many Norton Crypto users have taken to the community's online forum to complain they were having trouble withdrawing their earnings. Those gas fees are the same regardless of the amount of crypto being moved, so the system simply blocks withdrawals if the amount requested can't cover the transfer fees.

"There's a problem with the lithium (Li) ion batteries used in electric cars and for energy storage. The BBC reports that the most widely-used methods for battery recycling won't work nearly as well, since Li batteries are \"larger, heavier, much more complex and even dangerous if taken apart wrong.\"
Slashdot reader quonset shared their report:
In your average battery recycling plant, battery parts are shredded down into a powder, and then that powder is either melted (pyrometallurgy) or dissolved in acid (hydrometallurgy). But Li batteries are made up of lots of different parts that could explode if they're not disassembled carefully. And even when Li batteries are broken down this way, the products aren't easy to reuse. \"The current method of simply shredding everything and trying to purify a complex mixture results in expensive processes with low value products,\" says Andrew Abbott, a physical chemist at the University of Leicester. As a result, it costs more to recycle them than to mine more lithium to make new ones. Also, since large scale, cheap ways to recycle Li batteries are lagging behind, only about 5% of Li batteries are recycled globally, meaning the majority are simply going to waste....
Fortunately, the article points out that several labs are working on developing more efficient and eco-friendly ways to recycle Li batteries
[D]isassembling Li batteries is currently being done predominantly by hand in lab settings, which will need to change if direct recycling is to compete with more traditional recycling methods. \"In the future, there will need to be more technology in disassembly,\" says Abbott. \"If a battery is assembled using robots, it is logical that it needs to be disassembled in the same way.\" Abbott's team at the Faraday Institution in the UK is investigating the robotic disassembly of Li batteries as part of the ReLib Project, which specialises in the recycling and reuse of Li batteries.
The team has also found a way to achieve direct recycling of the anode and cathode using an ultrasonic probe, \"like what the dentist uses to clean your teeth,\" he explains. \"It focuses ultrasound on a surface which creates tiny bubbles that implode and blast the coating off the surface.\" This process avoids having to shred the battery parts, which can make recovering them exceedingly difficult. According to Abbott's team's research, this ultrasonic recycling method can process 100 times more material over the same period than the more traditional hydrometallurgy method. He says it can also be done for less than half the cost of creating a new battery from virgin material...
Another idea: replacing lithium-ion batteries altogether with something more eco-friendly:
Jodie Lutkenhaus, a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, has been working on a battery that is made of organic substances that can degrade on command. \"Many batteries today are not recycled because of the associated energy and labour cost,\" says Lutkenhaus. \"Batteries that degrade on command may simplify or lower the barrier to recycling. Eventually, these degradation products could be reconstituted back into a fresh new battery, closing the materials life-cycle loop.\"
It's a fair argument considering that, even when a Li battery is dismantled and its parts are refurbished, there will still be some parts that can't be saved and become waste. A degradable battery like the one Lutkenhaus' team is working on could be a more sustainable power source.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">

Scientists from the University of Oxford have today published a study in Clinical Cancer Research which shows that they can use a technique called NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) metabolomics analysis to identify patients with cancer. Specifically, they identify patients with cancer from within a population of generally unwell patients with non-specific symptoms like fatigue and weigh-loss &mdash; a traditionally hard-to-diagnose cohort.
The technique works because the NMR identifies small molecules called metabolites in the blood of patients and this information can then be used by machine learning to recognise patterns of metabolites specific to cancer, as well as identifying patients whose cancer has already spread.
The Guardian reports:
If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer.
The test can also tell if the disease has spread.
There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation.... \"The problem we've had in the past is that if they do have cancer, that cancer is growing all the time, and when they come back the cancers are often quite advanced,\" said Dr James Larkin, of the University of Oxford, who was involved in the research.

Details of an important new fossil site has just been published in the first Science Advances journal for the new year. McGraths Flat, in New South Wales, Australia, was once the location of this oxbow lake in a mesic rainforest. Today, superb examples of fossilised animals and plants from the Miocene epoch have been recovered, showing incredible detail, including melanosomes preserved in feathers of birds and the eyes of fossilised fish
\"The discovery of melanosomes &mdash; subcellular organelles that store the melanin pigment &mdash; allows us to reconstruct the colour pattern of birds and fishes that once lived at McGraths Flat,\" said Dr Michael Frese of the University of Canberra, one of the team's leaders. \"Interestingly, the colour itself is not preserved, but by comparing the size, shape and stacking pattern of the melanosomes in our fossils with melanosomes in extant specimens, we can often reconstruct colour and/or colour patterns.
\"Over the last three years a team of researchers has been secretly excavating the site, discovering thousands of specimens including rainforest plants, insects, spiders, fish and a bird feather,\" announced the University of New South Wales:

If you live in New Hampshire or in one of the neighbouring states, especially Massachusetts, please listen up!
\"If you are further away and unable to reach New Hampshire all that easily, please spread the following news anyway. It's important.\"
An important bill is being proposed in New Hampshire, which would enshrine much of what we know as Free Software into law... [H]ere is a paraphrasing of what it proposes:
- Specifically bans state-run websites from serving non-free javaScript to clients
- Creates a commission to provide oversight, watching the use of Free Software by state agencies
- Bans state agencies from using proprietary software &mdash; maybe this could include schools, in the future!
- If a person is tried in a criminal case, they have the right to audit the source code of any proprietary software that collects evidence against them
- Encourages data portability (able to transfer data from one program to another)
- Bans certain non-compete clauses and NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) pertaining to Free Software projects
- Bans state/local law enforcement from assisting with the enforcement of copyright claims against Free Software projects
- Bans state agencies from purchasing non-free software if free software exists, for a given task....
At first glance, it may not seem that the bill affects individuals, but don't be fooled; this is a hugely positive step forward for everyone! If the state is using Free Software, that most likely means it'll be used in education as well. Although perhaps not immediately and readily apparent, this is a stake in the heart of proprietary software's current dominance, because it would remove one key element of its attack against us; its abuse of education services. If education services are using Free Software, that means they'll probably have children (the ones being educated) using it too. This is a huge step, and it will result in more Free Software developers in the future. Free Software will become more and more mainstream to the masses, which can surely only be a good thing...!
[I]magine if more states like what they see and start to copy the new legislation. Now imagine that countries besides the U.S. start doing it, inspired by the US's success (and I think it will be a resounding success). Imagine a world where Free Software, free as in freedom, is the default everywhere. Imagine a world where Free Software licensing is required reading material in schools. Imagine a world where any five year old can install a free operating system such as GNU+Linux, and Computer Science is mandatory in schools from a young age. Imagine filing your tax returns with Free Software, exclusively. Imagine not even thinking about that, because it became the norm.
Imagine a world where proprietary software doesn't exist, because it is obsolete; entire generations of people are taught to value freedom, and to staunchly defend it, helping each other learn and grow (and produce better software in the process, with less bugs, because people are now free to do that, without relying on some evil company)...
Free Software is a revolution that we in the Free Software movement have rigorously upheld and fought for, over many years, but we still face an uphill battle because children are not taught in schools about free computing, nor are they encouraged to learn; they are taught to view computers as products to throw away every 1-2 years, that they can run a few apps on but otherwise are not allowed to do anything with. The concept of a general purpose, fully reprogrammable computer is heavily suppressed in mainstream culture. Most people in the world do not run a free operating system; the idea of a computer being a mere appliance is normalized (as opposed to the idea of it being a highly liberating tool for development and the expansion of human knowledge)....
Something is happening in New Hampshire, which could redefine our movement and give free software real power instead.
The post links to a state representative's tweet describing how supporters can testify in person to support the bill. \"If this bill is passed in New Hampshire, more states will likely follow,\" argues Libreboot.org. \"It will lead to a massively renewed drive to liberate all computer users, and U.S. laws tend to be copied/pasted around the world too. This bill, if passed, will have a hugely positive impact on Free Software at a global level...
\"The proprietary software companies like Microsoft and Apple will also be there, trying to argue the case against the use of Free Software.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">

Imagine a world where any five year old can install a free operating system such as GNU+Linux, and Computer Science is mandatory in schools from a young age. Imagine filing your tax returns with Free Software, exclusively. Imagine not even thinking about that, because it became the norm. 


Imagine a world where proprietary software doesn't exist, because it is obsolete; entire generations of people are taught to value freedom, and to staunchly defend it, helping each other learn and grow (and produce better software in the process, with less bugs, because people are now free to do that, without relying on some evil company)... 

Free Software is a revolution that we in the Free Software movement have rigorously upheld and fought for, over many years, but we still face an uphill battle because children are not taught in schools about free computing, nor are they encouraged to learn; they are taught to view computers as products to throw away every 1-2 years, that they can run a few apps on but otherwise are not allowed to do anything with. The concept of a general purpose, fully reprogrammable computer is heavily suppressed in mainstream culture. Most people in the world do not run a free operating system; the idea of a computer being a mere appliance is normalized (as opposed to the idea of it being a highly liberating tool for development and the expansion of human knowledge).... 

Something is happening in New Hampshire, which could redefine our movement and give free software real power instead. 


The post links to a state representative's tweet describing how supporters can testify in person to support the bill. \"If this bill is passed in New Hampshire, more states will likely follow,\" argues Libreboot.org. \"It will lead to a massively renewed drive to liberate all computer users, and U.S. laws tend to be copied/pasted around the world too. This bill, if passed, will have a hugely positive impact on Free Software at a global level... 

\"The proprietary software companies like Microsoft and Apple will also be there, trying to argue the case against the use of Free Software.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">

They trace the invention to the 1960s and electronics engineer Charles Kiesling, a naval veteran of the Korean War who \"spent his immediate post-war years on a new challenge: the exploding computing age.\"
Still decades away from personal computers &mdash; let alone portable ones &mdash; Kiesling was joining the ranks of engineers tinkering with room-sized computers like the IBM 650 or the aging ENIAC. He joined Sperry Rand, now Unisys, in 1955, and helped develop the kind of computer guts that casual users rarely think about. This includes innards like logic circuitry, which enable your computer to make complex conditional decisions like \"or,\" \"and,\" or \"if only\" instead of simply \"yes\" or \"no\". One of these seemingly innocuous advancements was a 1967 patent filing Kiesling made for a blinking cursor....\"
According to a post on a computer science message board from a user purporting to be Kiesling's son, the inspiration for this invention was simply utility. \"I remember him telling me the reason behind the blinking cursor, and it was simple,\" Kiesling's son writes. \"He said there was nothing on the screen to let you know where the cursor was in the first place. So he wrote up the code for it so he would know where he was ready to type on the Cathode Ray Tube.\"
The blinking, it turns out, is simply a way to catch the coders' attention and stand apart from a sea of text.
The article credits Apple with popularizing blinking cursors to the masses. And it also remembers a fun story about Steve Jobs (shared by Thomas Haigh, a professor of technology history at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee):
While he was in support of the blinking cursor itself, Haigh says Steve Jobs was famously against controlling it using cursor keys. Jobs attempted &mdash; and failed &mdash; to remove these keys from the original Mac in an effort to force users into using a mouse instead. In an interaction with biographer Walter Isaacson years later, he even pried them off with his car keys before signing his autograph on the keyboard.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">

"\"Mirror, mirror...is deployed,\" NASA tweeted Saturday, confirming that the James Webb telescope \"has taken on its final form. For the next ~6 months, the space telescope will cool down, calibrate its instruments, and prepare to #UnfoldTheUniverse.\"
With a diameter of 21.3 feet, the telescope's mirror is the largest mirror ever launched into space &mdash; a joint effort with the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency.
\"Good news keep coming,\" the ESA tweeted yesterday. \" Mike Menzel, NASA Webb Mission Systems Engineer said yesterday in press brief that Webb might have 'quite a bit of fuel margin... Roughly speaking, it's around 20 years of propellant', adding that's still to be determined.\"
Long-time Slashdot reader cusco writes that \"For years naysayers have confidently declared that the numerous automated operations necessary to fully deploy the James Webb Space Telescope were going to guarantee its failure. Today they've been proven wrong.\"
From NASA.gov:
\"Today, NASA achieved another engineering milestone decades in the making. While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an unprecedented mission that is on the precipice of seeing the light from the first galaxies and discovering the mysteries of our universe. Each feat already achieved and future accomplishment is a testament to the thousands of innovators who poured their life's passion into this mission....\"
The world's largest and most complex space science telescope will now begin moving its 18 primary mirror segments to align the telescope optics. The ground team will command 126 actuators on the backsides of the segments to flex each mirror &mdash; an alignment that will take months to complete. Then the team will calibrate the science instruments prior to delivering Webb's first images this summer.
\"I am so proud of the team &mdash; spanning continents and decades &mdash; that delivered this first-of-its kind achievement,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate in NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Webb's successful deployment exemplifies the best of what NASA has to offer: the willingness to attempt bold and challenging things in the name of discoveries still unknown.\"
Soon, Webb will also undergo a third mid-course correction burn &mdash; one of three planned to place the telescope precisely in orbit around the second Lagrange point, commonly known as L2, nearly 1 million miles from Earth. This is Webb's final orbital position, where its sunshield will protect it from light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon that could interfere with observations of infrared light. Webb is designed to peer back over 13.5 billion years to capture infrared light from celestial objects, with much higher resolution than ever before, and to study our own solar system as well as distant worlds.
\"The successful completion of all of the Webb Space Telescope's deployments is historic,\" said Gregory L. Robinson, Webb program director at NASA Headquarters. \"This is the first time a NASA-led mission has ever attempted to complete a complex sequence to unfold an observatory in space &mdash; a remarkable feat for our team, NASA, and the world.\"
Saturday the Canadian Space Agency tweeted \"Wow.... Congratulations to everyone involved. We can't wait to see what the telescope has in store for the international astronomy community!\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">

This program will also provide curriculum &mdash; NSTA's Using AI to Monitor Health and Mobile CSP's Alexa in Space &mdash; aimed at teaching high school Science and AP Computer Science Principles students \"how to program their own Alexa skills that could help astronauts [and 'inexperienced space travelers, such as tourists'] solve problems in space and communities at home\" using MIT's App Inventor.

 App Inventor, some may recall, was developed at Google to bring programming to the masses only to be suddenly abandoned. App Inventor was later picked up by MIT and &mdash; with support from Google and millions in NSF funding &mdash; eventually found its way into curriculum developed for the new AP CSP course aimed at mainstreaming AP Computer Science.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">
