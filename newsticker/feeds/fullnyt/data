            <p>
             President Trump predicted “bedlam” and a lack of clarity about the presidential results until weeks after Election Day as he barnstormed Pennsylvania, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made his first joint appearance with former President Barack Obama at an event in Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last Saturday before Election Day offered traditional last-minute frantic campaigning in battleground states played against the backdrop of the extraordinary rancor, high stakes and sense of disruption reflecting a pandemic, an economic downturn and recurring protests and unrest at the close of Mr. Trump’s first term.
            </p>
            <p>
             In remarks in Newtown, Pa., and Reading, Pa., Mr. Trump stoked fears of an election left unsettled after voting closes on Nov. 3 and about the prospects that ballots would not count.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You’re going to be waiting for weeks” as votes are counted, Mr. Trump declared in Newtown.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Many, many days,” he went on. “So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision, because Pennsylvania’s very big. We’re going to be waiting. Nov. 3 is going to come and go, and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country.”
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             At his next stop, in Reading, Mr. Trump derided a Supreme Court decision rejecting a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to decide whether the state could continue accepting ballots for three days after Nov. 3.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You see what’s going on, right?” Mr. Trump said of Democrats. “Somebody’s going to play games, and they just got an extension. What’s the extension all about? Wouldn’t you like to hear, Nov. 3, we win, we lose? We win, we lose. Whatever.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The president called the decision “disappointing” and added, “Many, many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. They talk about we control the Supreme — well we don’t control the Supreme Court. That was a terrible decision.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The question of how long ballots can be accepted in battleground states has been a dominant one as Nov. 3 approaches. So has the question of whether Mr. Trump will try to declare victory if he is leading in specific states on Election Day, regardless of whether they have been called in his favor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump barely addressed the coronavirus pandemic at his first two stops, other than to praise his administration, complain about Mr. Biden’s focus on the pandemic and to falsely claim once again that the country was “rounding the turn” as the number of daily new cases nationally has spiked to almost 100,000.
            </p>

            <p>
             Mr. Obama, appearing with Mr. Biden in Flint, Mich., at their first stop of the day, mocked Mr. Trump as heartless.
            </p>

            <p>
             Noting Mr. Trump’s baseless claim a day earlier that doctors were profiting from coronavirus deaths, Mr. Obama said, “He cannot fathom — he does not understand — the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump is continuing to hold crowded rallies as the pandemic rages, and Mr. Obama ridiculed him for his fixation on crowd sizes, asking: “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden spoke next, praising Mr. Obama and ripping Mr. Trump over the pandemic as well. He too invoked Mr. Trump’s baseless statement made at a rally on Friday about doctors and coronavirus-related fatalities.
            </p>
            <p>
             “What in the hell is wrong with this man?” Mr. Biden asked. “Excuse my language, but think about it. It’s perverted. He may believe it because he doesn’t do anything other than for money.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Where both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden campaigned on Saturday was as revealing as what both men said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two states were part of the so-called Blue Wall — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which have leaned Democratic in recent national elections but which were crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 over Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has struggled in all three states throughout the 2020 campaign and is pressing to keep at least one of the three as part of his map this year, in an election cycle marked by a coronavirus pandemic and an economic recession. Pennsylvania is seen by Mr. Trump’s advisers as the likeliest state among the three for him to win.
            </p>

             In Newtown in Bucks County, Mr. Trump delivered a subdued speech, speaking from the teleprompter at first, to several hundred people seated in folding chairs arrayed in a field in front of a stage and a podium.

            <p>
             The speech took place in a field in front of the farmhouse where George Washington planned the crossing of the Delaware River. The small crowd sat close together, mostly unmasked. Unlike it has done at his other rallies, Mr. Trump’s campaign did not position energetic supporters in a stand behind him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president criticized Mr. Biden’s record on trade in a state hit hard in recent years by job losses and after the economic downturn this year caused by the coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump’s teleprompter appeared to have problems at one point, but for the first 45 minutes of his appearance, the president tried to stick to a speech that appeared designed to present him in a more “presidential” light, avoiding some of the angry and defensive outbursts that have been central to his rallies.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then he appeared to lose interest in the speech and began to riff about Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, about his own news coverage and how unfair he thinks the coverage has been of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             He mocked Mr. Biden for wearing sunglasses and dismissed his Democratic rival as merely a puppet of liberal Democrats in Congress.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             And he went on a long, improvised riff about his administration’s production of ventilators as he downplayed concerns about the coronavirus even as the country neared 100,000 new cases a day, with hospitalizations spiking.

             “We have done an incredible job. At some point they are going to recognize that,” Mr. Trump said after mocking Mr. Biden for focusing too much on the virus. “We’ve done an A-plus job. I give ourselves a D, or maybe an F, in terms of public relations.”
            </p>
            <p>
             On Saturday, he said of Mr. Biden’s concerns about the pandemic, “We agree, we agree it’s serious,” but added that his rival’s “only plan is to make you a prisoner in your home, a prisoner in your own country.”.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Reading, Mr. Trump seemed buoyed by a bigger crowd than at his previous stop, as he talked about his own bout of the coronavirus and the fact that the first lady had caught it as well. Joking, he said, “At least those rumors that we don’t live together turned out to be false.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, for the second straight day, Mr. Biden traveled to the Upper Midwest, a critical region where he has multiple ambitions: to win back voters who drifted to Mr. Trump in 2016 and to turn out as many traditional Democratic voters, including Black residents, as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             After making stops in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin on Friday, Mr. Biden devoted Saturday to Michigan. He enlisted a marquee surrogate to help his cause: Mr. Obama, whose presence the campaign hoped would excite voters and help drive turnout in the campaign’s final days.
             
             
            </p>
            <p>
             In the past two weeks, Mr. Obama campaigned solo for Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania and Florida, but Saturday was the first time in the general election that he and Mr. Biden had campaigned together in person. The former president has the potential to help Mr. Biden, who served two terms as his vice president, with key groups like Black voters as well as younger people who might not be naturally drawn to a septuagenarian moderate like Mr. Biden.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           
            <p>
             At a drive-in car rally in Flint, Mr. Obama laid into Mr. Trump over his handling of the pandemic, emphasizing a theme that has been a central message for Mr. Biden in the closing days of the campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, in Detroit, hundreds of people waited in cars to see Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden on Belle Isle, a state park on an island in the middle of the Detroit River with expansive views of the skylines of Detroit and of Windsor, Ontario.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The last four years have been hell,” said Miriam Pizana of Detroit, who came to the rally with her daughter Kristen. “We never knew what the chief of staff or communications directors’ names were before, and now we know them all, and not for anything good.”

                     “Here we are, the worst week, this week! I mean, we’ve been going through this now for months. The federal government has had an opportunity to respond — for months. And his closing argument, this week is that the press and people are too focused on Covid! ‘Covid, Covid, Covid,’ he’s complaining. He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage. And now he’s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic. Think about that. He said this just yesterday. Said doctors are overblowing it because they’re going to make money off it — doctors! He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck. There was just a study by Stanford University that just came out showing thousands of people are likely to have gotten sick because of these rallies he’s holding. What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that? He’s always worried — this is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worrying about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugs him. He talked about, he’s still talking about that. Does he have nothing better to worry about? Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized? What’s with crowds? Well you know, I’ve had crowds before, you know, had quite a few. But, you know, when a country is going through a pandemic, that’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about!”

          FLINT, Mich. — Former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tag-teamed President Trump in their first joint appearance of 2020, with the former president joking that Mr. Trump was “traumatized” by low turnout at his childhood birthday parties and Mr. Biden suggesting he would have bopped Mr. Trump in their younger days.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the final weekend of the campaign, Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama began Saturday with a drive-in rally in Flint in a bid to maximize turnout. Later, they held another drive-in rally in Detroit, where Stevie Wonder performed. The Biden campaign also announced that Mr. Obama would campaign in Atlanta and South Florida on Monday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Obama won Michigan twice, and Genesee County, home to Flint, is an example of a place where Democrats lost significant ground in 2016 compared with how the Obama-Biden ticket had fared.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Flint, the former president began by praising Mr. Biden for his decency, then pivoted to offense, the task
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/us/politics/obama-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           he has pursued with vigor
          </a>
          in appearances over the past two weeks. He laced into his successor for

           suggesting on Friday
          </a>
          that physicians are magnifying the severity of the pandemic to make money.
         </p>
         <p>
          “He cannot fathom — he does not understand — the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck,” Mr. Obama said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The former president also took aim at Mr. Trump’s fixation on the size of the crowds that turn out for him. “What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size?” he asked. “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?”
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Trump for his reported comments about America’s war dead and noted that Mr. Trump “likes to portray himself as a tough guy.” Then he suggested he would have wanted to punch Mr. Trump back in the day. “When you were in high school, wouldn’t you have liked to take the shot?” Mr. Biden said. “Anyway, that’s a different story, but anyway. A macho man.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Later, in Detroit, Mr. Biden mocked Mr. Trump for having written off as business expenses
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/business/trump-taxes-hair.html\" title=\"\">
           more than $70,000 paid to style his hair
          </a>
          during “The Apprentice.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I tell you what, man,” Mr. Biden said. “I hardly have any hair, but I’d rather have what I have.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Their visit to Michigan also included a clutch shot by Mr. Obama, who drained a 3-pointer in a school gym in Flint and then walked off the court. “That’s what I do,” he said.

                     “And I think we will win Minnesota. We’re very close last time. And we should win it, when they let Minneapolis burn, we should win it. But I think we’re going to win it. And again, 1972 was the last time. Can you believe that? I think we’re going to do it. We’ll find out. You’re going to know it about — Well I hope, based on the Supreme Court, they don’t delay it too long, this decision yesterday, I will tell you was not a good decision. You’re allowed to wait days to count and days to have the final count. You’re allowed to have time limits beyond Nov. 3. So what does this mean? The whole world, and our nation, is going to be waiting and waiting and waiting to hear who won. They’re going to — You’re going to be waiting. You’re going to be waiting for weeks and a very dangerous thing happens Nov. 3 and now you have to wait and wait. And very bad things can happen with ballots during that period of Nov. 3 to whatever date they gave them. Many many days. So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania is very big. And as you know, there was another state. But perhaps other states as well. This is a terrible thing that they’ve done to our country. And that’s the United States Supreme Court I’m talking about. That is a terrible, political, horrible, decision that they made. We’re going to be waiting Nov. 3 is going to come and go. And we’re not going to know and you’re going to have bedlam in our country.” ”This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country. And I say it, and I say it loud, and I say it proud.” “Just three days from now and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you’re there. And sure as we’re here together that wave is forming and they see it. They see it on all sides and there’s not a thing they can do about it.”

          President Trump predicted on Saturday that the presidential election would not be decided on Tuesday, warning that “you’re going to be waiting for weeks” and suggesting — with no evidence — that “very bad things” could happen while states are counting ballots in the days after Election Day.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s comments came as he kicked off four Saturday campaign stops in Pennsylvania with a subdued speech to several hundred people, boasting about his accomplishments and attacking his rival while he predicted victory next week.
         </p>
         <p>
          “So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania’s very big,” Mr. Trump said at his first stop in Newtown. “We’re going to be waiting, Nov. 3 is going to come and go, and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s campaign has aggressively sought to prevent Pennsylvania and other states from extending the time they are allowed to count mail-in ballots, which have been used in greater numbers than ever before because of concerns about in-person voting during the pandemic. On Friday, the
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/supreme-court-pennsylvania-north-carolina-absentee-ballots.html\" title=\"\">
           Supreme Court ruled that Pennsylvania officials can accept absentee ballots for three days
          </a>
          after Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And I say it, and I say it loud and I say it proud.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Despite his concerns about ballots, Mr. Trump predicted that Republicans would win the presidency and do well in congressional elections, waving aside polls which suggest that Democrats are leading in battleground states across the country.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s first speech took place in a field in front of the farmhouse where George Washington planned the crossing of the Delaware River. The small crowd sat close together, mostly unmasked. Mr. Trump did not have his typical backdrop of energetic supporters standing behind him.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was more animated in his second rally of the day, in Reading, where he spoke before a boisterous crowd of several thousand supporters. The president called his rivals names, lashed out at the news media, made false assertions about his record and suggested again that the election would not be decided on Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          He played video clips on a large screen showing his rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., making verbal gaffes, with Sean Hannity, a Fox News host, calling him a “clear and present danger to this country.” The president also played a Halloween-themed television ad on the screen showing an adult trick-or-treater approaching a home wearing a Biden mask.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Know who you’re voting for. Don’t get tricked,” the person said, taking off the mask to reveal the face of Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Trump has two more rallies in Pennsylvania as he races to try to catch up to Mr. Biden, his Democratic rival, who has consistently led in polls in the crucial swing state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Newtown, Mr. Trump’s teleprompter appeared to have problems at one point, but for the most part he tried to stick to a speech that appeared designed to present him in a more “presidential” light, avoiding some of the angry and defensive rants that have been central to his rallies.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Reading, Mr. Trump seemed impressed by the size of his crowd, suggesting that the passion among his supporters would save the day for his re-election campaign.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This doesn’t seem like someone who is going to come in second, do you?” Mr. Trump asked. “I don’t think so.”

          Police officers and sheriff’s deputies in Graham, N.C., deployed a chemical spray and arrested eight people at a march and rally on Saturday that were intended to honor George Floyd and encourage people to vote, according to the police and participants.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I am truly disturbed by the fact that people who are charged to protect and to serve” sprayed a chemical agent on marchers who were taking people to the polls, said the Rev. Gregory B. Drumwright, an organizer of
          <a href=\"https://www.thetimesnews.com/story/news/2020/10/14/activist-announces-i-am-change-march-wednesday-press-conference/3658546001/\" title=\"\">

          , who was among those arrested.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We never got to the polls because the sheriff’s office worked overtime to find a way to quell our efforts and suppress our voices,” he said in an interview.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Graham police said in a statement that officers had deployed a “pepper-based vapor” after the marchers blocked traffic in the street, “causing a traffic and safety hazard.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Eventually, the march moved on to a courthouse for a speaking program, where the police also intervened. Officers once again sprayed a “pepper-based vapor onto the ground to assist in dispersing the crowd,” the police said, adding that several people had ignored commands to leave.
         </p>
         <p>
          The people arrested were charged with offenses including failing to disperse and one count of assault on a law enforcement officer, the police said.

          Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is up for re-election on Tuesday,
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NC_Governor/status/1322697365636239361\" title=\"\">
           said on Twitter
          </a>
          that the confrontation was “unacceptable.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “Peaceful demonstrators should be able to have their voices heard and voter intimidation in any form cannot be tolerated,” Mr. Cooper wrote.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mayor Ian Baltutis of nearby Burlington, N.C., who marched and spoke at the event, said it had drawn a multiracial crowd of about 150 to 200 people in Graham, a city of about 15,000 located 50 miles northwest of Raleigh.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Baltutis said that after a sheriff’s deputy ordered the crowd to disperse within five minutes, deputies used the spray and tried to push people across the street.
         </p>
         <p>
          “As an elected leader, it’s not an example of the professional policing and de-escalation we would expect,” Mr. Baltutis said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Alamance County Sheriff’s Office, which also used the spray, according to participants, did not respond to requests for comment.

          AUSTIN, Texas — Multiple vehicles bearing Trump flags and signs surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus heading from San Antonio to Austin on Friday, forcing campaign officials to scrap two campaign events, according to
          
          
          reports by Democratic officials on Saturday.
         </p>
         <p>
          The vehicles surrounded the bus on busy Interstate 35 and appeared to be attempting to slow it down and force it to the side of the road, according to social media posts from witnesses and accounts by party activists. In one instance, the vehicles pulled in front of the bus and tried to stop in the middle of the highway.
         </p>
         <p>
          Katie Naranjo, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, tweeted that Trump supporters also “ran into a person’s car, yelling curse words and threats.” The bus was occupied by campaign staff workers, who notified local law enforcement, which assisted the vehicle in reaching its destination, party officials said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Out of “an abundance of caution,” they said, the campaign canceled an event scheduled for later that day at a parking lot belonging to the Texas A.F.L.-C.I.O. in downtown Austin. A campaign event in suburban Pflugerville was also scrapped.
         </p>
         
          
         <p>
          “Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way,” Tariq Thowfeek, the Texas communications director for the Biden for President campaign, said in a statement.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Our supporters will continue to organize their communities for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot,” Mr. Thowfeek said, “and to the Texans who disrupted our events: We’ll see you on November 3rd.

          More than 90 million votes have already been cast in the 2020 presidential election — about 65 percent of the total turnout in 2016, according to data updated Saturday afternoon by the
          <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html\" title=\"\">
           U.S. Elections Project
          </a>
          , an effort led by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number of early votes cast has already shattered the previous early turnout record set in 2016, thanks in large part to expansions of mail and absentee voting put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 91 million ballots have been sent to voters through the mail, and as of Saturday, 57 million of them have been returned. Over 32 million votes have been cast early and in person, according to the Elections Project.

           A New York Times analysis
          </a>
          of polling and ballot-request data shows that more Democrats have requested absentee ballots than Republicans have, and that most Republicans are likely to vote in person on Election Day. Experts have warned against drawing conclusions about the outcome of the race from early vote data for that reason and others. (Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s apparent edge in the early vote was
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/early-voting-registration.html\" title=\"\">
           widely reported
          </a>
          in 2016 in the days before she ultimately lost the Electoral College.)
         </p>
         <p>
          Still, experts have acknowledged that the early vote data so far does suggest turnout may exceed the 139 million votes cast in 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
          The early vote is being watched particularly closely in crucial swing states like Florida, a state the president narrowly carried against Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and where
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/politics/who-will-win-florida-polls.html\" title=\"\">
           polling is showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. slightly ahead

          . Data from the Elections Project shows that about 8.3 million ballots have been cast in Florida, a total representing roughly 59 percent of the registered voters in the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Texas, more than 9.6 million ballots had been cast as of Friday,

           more than the roughly 8.9 million Texans who voted statewide four years ago

          PITTSBURGH — In 2016, Allegheny County, which includes the city of Pittsburgh, voted for Hillary Clinton by a 16-point margin. At the same time, it gave Donald Trump more votes than he received in any other county in the state.
         </p>

          The battle over these margins is a matter of suburban geography, as a solidly blue city pushes further out against an ever-reddening western Pennsylvania, a shoving match that will go far in determining the winner of the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the front lines of that Democratic push is an army of “resistance” groups formed immediately after the 2016 election, mostly consisting of midcareer women who were electrified by Mr. Trump’s election. Marie Norman, 55, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, is one of them: Her group, called the Order of the Phoenix, has been churning out postcards and deploying door-to-door canvassers since forming nearly four years ago.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Saturday morning, Professor Norman was canvassing in the suburbs south of the city for statehouse candidates, including a state senator trying to hold a seat in hotly contested territory on the frontiers of the Democrats’ post-2016 suburban advance. “I feel a lot of energy this time canvassing — different from 2018,” she said. “I’m sure there’s more energy for Trump, too.”
         </p>
         <p>
          A few minutes later, an S.U.V. driving down the quiet street proved her point: It was covered with Trump decals and flying Trump flags.
         </p>
         <p>
          Along three suburban blocks, Professor Norman met Biden voters who were fervently hoping that he wins and others who were somewhat skeptical of him; a Trump voter who ripped up Professor Norman’s fliers at the door; and another who had a friendly discussion about not wanting to brainwash his children with his own political opinions. That she would be meeting all of these people while campaigning for a state house candidate would have been unthinkable before the 2016 election.
         </p>
         <p>
          Professor Norman said she felt confident in a Biden victory in the county in terms of votes already cast — the Democrats currently hold a nearly 4-1 advantage in returned mail-in and absentee ballots — but she worried about whether the ballots would all be counted. A Trump win will be hard to recover from, she said, but win or lose, she plans to keep the Order of the Phoenix going, with a future focus on judicial elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The 2016 election, she said, “totally changed my life.”

          MIAMI — The biggest pool of votes in Florida is in Miami-Dade County, where turnout has been lagging among Black and Hispanic voters, both key demographics for Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Senator Kamala Harris spent Saturday in South Florida, trying to shore up votes in the final weekend of early voting, which has traditionally been when Democrats here close the gap with Republicans.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Everybody needs to vote,” Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told reporters in Palm Beach County. “We’re here to say, ‘Listen, everything is at stake.’”
         </p>
         <p>
          Democrats have plenty of work to do: Black voters and Puerto Rican voters, who tend to lean Democratic, have been casting ballots at a lower rate than the rest of the electorate in Miami-Dade, according to an analysis by Hawkfish, a Democratic technology and data firm.
         </p>
         <p>
          About 50 percent of Black voters and 45 percent of Puerto Rican voters have voted, compared to 58 percent of other Hispanic voters, 61 percent of white voters and 62 percent of
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/us/miami-cuban-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           Cuban-American voters
          </a>
          , who tend to lean conservative.
         </p>
         <p>
          Miami-Dade has about 1.5 million registered voters. Hillary Clinton won the county by some 300,000 votes, a margin that Joseph R. Biden Jr. is not expected to match — and that was not enough to win Mrs. Clinton the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Voters of Cuban, Colombian, Nicaraguan and

          </a>
          descent have appeared particularly receptive to the Republican narrative that Mr. Biden, who has a long record as a centrist, and Ms. Harris are socialists. At her first event of the day in Miami, Ms. Harris flicked at that concern.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Joe and I are proud, patriotic Americans,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          But the message has stuck.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re not leftists, as Cubans,” said Gloria Davis, a 59-year-old Republican, after voting for President Trump on Saturday at the library in Westchester, a conservative stronghold that as of Friday had the most early votes cast in the county. “I see the leftists in the Democratic Party.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Republicans kept hammering away at the line outside the Coral Gables Library, another voting site. Under the blazing sun, Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and other local Republicans denounced Democrats as closet socialists.
         </p>
         <p>
          “In Washington, they vote just like
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html\" title=\"\">
           Bernie Sanders
          </a>
          ,” Mr. Rubio said in Spanish as salsa music blared in the background.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden’s troubles with Black voters came up on Friday in a phone call between the campaign and local Democratic members of Congress ahead of Ms. Harris’s visit. Representative Frederica Wilson of Miami Gardens, who is African-American, raised concerns about the campaign’s ground game, according to a person briefed on the call. Ms. Wilson appeared with Ms. Harris at an event on Saturday, and the Biden team has planned a slew of Souls to the Polls events targeting Black voters on Sunday.
         </p>
         <p>
          One encouraging sign for Democrats has been increased turnout in Broward County, the most Democratic in the state, where Caribbean-American voters have been enthusiastic about Ms. Harris, whose father is Jamaican.
         </p>
         <p>
          “When we talk about African-American and Caribbean voters in Florida, they want to know they have a president who understands the commonality between all of us,” Ms. Harris said. “They want a president who speaks to our higher purposes and our better angels, as opposed to speaking to hate and division.”

          ROSWELL, Ga. — On Saturday afternoon, Senator Kelly Loeffler held a rally in the northern Atlanta suburbs, an affluent area that used to be a Republican safe space until Donald Trump
          <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/trump-wins-georgia-but-turns-some-atlanta-suburbs-blue/8HY6eDcPhoxEK5TiUcPeXJ/\" title=\"\">
           lost it
          </a>
          in 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
          If some voters in these suburbs have determined that the Republican Party has gone too far to the right — or fear that Trumpism has twisted the party — Ms. Loeffler had not come to change those kinds of minds.
         </p>
         <p>
          Standing on the back of a pickup in the parking lot of a mid-rise office building, Ms. Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat 10 months ago by Gov. Brian Kemp, bragged about her support for the president. She warned of the rise of socialism, the “fake news” and “the deep state” (“It’s all real,” she said). She gave a warm-up speaking spot to Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican congressional candidate best known for her embrace of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Loeffler also indicated that she had no plans to move to the center. And that could serve as a preview of the tenor of the complicated special-election contest for her seat, one that could help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Nov. 3 ballot is a crowded one, and if no candidate gets a majority of votes, the race will go to a January runoff. Leading in

          , the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Ms. Loeffler has been mostly duking it out with a rival Republican, Representative Doug Collins.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two Republicans have been engaged in a virtual primary of sorts, throwing mud and striving to out-conservative each other. And while some Republicans thought Ms. Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, might take a moderate path to win over suburban women, she instead tacked hard right as a campaigner,
          <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/15/kelly-loeffler-marjorie-taylor-greene-endorsement-429635\" title=\"\">
           enthusiastically accepting
          </a>
          the endorsement of Ms. Greene.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Roswell, before an outdoor crowd of about 100 people, Ms. Loeffler issued an awkwardly phrased sentence or two whose message was nonetheless clear: This is who she is. And she is not changing.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve had people give me feedback and say, you know, maybe you’re, you know, maybe you’d do more, get in the middle, whatever,” she said. “I am who I am because of my values.”

         <p>
          PHILADELPHIA — Add Debra Messing and Kathy Najimy to the thousands of canvassers spread out across Philadelphia for the Biden campaign on Saturday.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two actors went knocking door to door with Sharif Street, a state senator, as the Biden campaign’s turnout operation kicked into high gear in this epicenter of Democratic support in the critical battleground state.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Everything is on Pennsylvania, this is it,” said Ms. Messing as she rallied a group of canvassers on the corner of North Carlisle Street and West Susquehanna Avenue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Throughout the city, the Biden campaign has been deploying volunteers to the doors of likely Democratic voters who either have not returned their absentee ballot or never requested one. Nearly two million registered Democrats requested absentee ballots, compared with fewer than 790,000 Republicans.
         </p>
         
          
         <p>
          The message on Saturday from the canvassers was to make sure voters know how to navigate either the absentee ballot drop-off process, or voting on Election Day, with the focus on making a “plan to vote.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’m going to vote, and vote for Biden,” said Kevin Robinson, 66. Ms. Messing let out a whoop and told Mr. Robinson, who was favoring his left knee, that if he was physically unable to stand in line, he could move ahead in the line. “I’ll need that,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Messing and Ms. Najimy, who have long been politically active, said that even after having volunteered in previous elections, this one felt different and more urgent.
         </p>
         <p>
          “There is a feeling of unrest that I’ve never experienced before,” Ms. Najimy said. “It’s like Donald Trump has taken a hammer to whatever unity we had and smashed it.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, having celebrity canvassers can help a door-knocking operation’s success. While most canvassers are lucky to see half of the doors they knock crack open, nearly every resident came out to see Ms. Messing and Ms. Najimy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Vendetta Sample, 56, saw the two women and ran down her stoop to greet them. “I voted, I voted early,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Did you vote for —” Ms. Messing started to ask before she was cut off.
         </p>
         <p>
          “You dang know I did,” Ms. Sample said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Biden campaign app also had a man named Sean on its list who lived at Ms. Sample’s address. Ms. Messing asked about Sean and if he voted.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Sean’s not here, he’s working,” said Ms. Sample. “I don’t know if he voted.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “You’re going to call Sean and you’re going to say we came to see him, and you’re going to say you promised us that you would kick his ass if he doesn’t vote.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Sample smiled, pantomiming a kick, when her young grandson, wearing a Spider-Man mask, poked his head out.
         </p>
         <p>
          “What you say about my daddy?” he asked. “Say that again and I’ll punch you in your face.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The entire canvassing team laughed.
         </p>
         <p>
          “That’s Philly,” one said.

          SUN CITY, Ariz. — Don’t believe the polls. Don’t believe the media. And definitely do not believe the Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was the message from Republican leaders to the party’s foot soldiers gathering Saturday in Sun City. The volunteers were getting ready to fan out in this retirement community in Maricopa County, where Donald Trump won in 2016 with 49 percent of the vote, to rally voters for Mr. Trump and Martha McSally, the Republican senator whom polls have consistently shown running behind her Democratic challenger.
         </p>
         <p>
          “You all know why this is the most consequential election in our life,” Ms. McSally told the crowd inside the local Republican headquarters, flanked by cardboard cutouts of Mr. Trump and former President Ronald Reagan. “They’re coming after our county. They’re coming after our state.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Still, Ms. McSally tried to strike a cheerful tone.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re on the verge of a great American comeback,” she said to a round of cheers.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was little need to convince the crowd, who appeared to be optimistic about the party’s chances.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve never seen energy like we’re seeing now,” said Patti Thompson, a 72-year-old party activist who wore a Women for Trump T-shirt emblazoned with an image of a stars-and-stripes stiletto. “People care about saving our country. You can’t let the liberals take — we cannot let them run our country.”

          MILWAUKEE — Mary Beth Mathes brought her ballot to a drop box outside a public library on Milwaukee’s South Side Saturday, but she was missing one thing: the witness signature required by Wisconsin state law.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Ms. Mathes, a flight attendant for United Airlines, went inside the library to find Carol Dohm, the supervisor for the city’s early voting site at the library.
         </p>
         <p>
          On top of the drop box, Ms. Dohm signed Ms. Mathes’s ballot, then Ms. Mathes signed it too. Then both women engaged in a brief celebration, shimmying, throwing their arms in the air and yelling “yeaaaaah!”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I was just so excited to vote,” said Ms. Mathes, 50, who voted for President Trump. “I’m going to be back in town on Election Day, but I didn’t want to deal with the long lines.”
         </p>
         <p>
          While Milwaukee is heavily Democratic, its South Side, filled with a mix of Hispanic and older white voters, is the most Republican part of the city.
         </p>
         <p>
          A slow procession of voters came to the Tippecanoe branch of the Milwaukee Public Library Saturday. Just five voters at a time were allowed inside the area within the library set aside for voting, where two machines were in use. Officials on site said the foot traffic had been much busier during the week, and the line had moved slowly last weekend, too.
         </p>
         <p>
          Milwaukee is one of just a few Wisconsin municipalities with in-person early voting this weekend. State law allows in-person early voting from Oct. 20 through Sunday, though most communities held their last early voting day on Friday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Voters who have received an absentee ballot but have yet to return it have until the polls close Tuesday night to either deposit the ballots in a drop box or hand deliver them to a municipal clerk or a polling place.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Mathes’s experience demonstrates one last hurdle to absentee voting that Wisconsin Republicans put in place when they enacted a series of electoral reforms in the last decade — finding a witness signature, which can be difficult for people who live alone during the pandemic, which is raging across Wisconsin.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Mathes said she voted for Mr. Trump because of his economic record and his stance opposing abortion rights. In a second term, she said, she hopes he would end many of the pandemic-related restrictions that have been put in place.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t know if we can resolve it,” she said of the virus. “Hopefully we can open things up again and keep people working.”

            Ohio could be decided by women in the hotly contested suburbs.

         <p>
          COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016, but multiple polls have painted a troubling new picture for Mr. Trump in a state that no Republican has ever won a presidential race without.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Ohio, as in much else of the nation, Mr. Trump has bled support from suburban voters. And so with Mr. Biden’s hold on Ohio’s metro centers, and Mr. Trump’s commanding lead in its rural areas, the tossup state could come down to voters like Amy W., a white college-educated Republican from Westerville, a suburb northeast of Columbus.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Saturday afternoon, she stood in line at her Franklin County polling station, located in a shopping center. The line ran through much of the parking lot but moved swiftly. Amy, 55, would only whisper that she planned to vote for Mr. Biden and declined to give her last name because she was afraid, she said, of Mr. Trump’s supporters.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was also why she was voting early: “When Trump said he was going to have people out watching, that scared the heck out of me,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amy, a payroll coordinator, said she was voting for Mr. Biden in honor of her mother, who died earlier this year in a nursing home after contracting the coronavirus. She blamed Mr. Trump for downplaying the threat of the virus.
         </p>
         <p>
          “She was alone, and I couldn’t be with her,” she said of her mother, and began crying softly. “I feel like I let her down.”

          In the final days of an historic campaign season, Democrats in Georgia are searching for people like Linda Wingfield.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Friday, Ms. Wingfield left her shift as a fast-food cook and cast a ballot for the very first time — at 59 years old.
         </p>
         <p>
          “It means a lot to me,” Ms. Wingfield said as she lined up along with about 15 other Black voters outside the Adams Park Library in Atlanta.
         </p>
         <p>
          After decades of staying away from the polls, Ms. Wingfield was spurred to vote by a strong dislike for President Trump.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We need somebody to help us, not destroy us,” she said, calling on “God’s faith” to elect Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
         </p>
         <p>
          Friday was the final day for early, in-person voting in Georgia. And as the numbers were posted on Saturday, some experts saw worrying signs in the numbers for Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of the nearly 2.7 million people who cast their ballots in early, in-person voting, only 709,000, or 26.4 percent, were identified as Black.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number does not include absentee ballots, and thousands of those have not been received.
         </p>
         <p>
          Even so, Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia in Athens, said the percentage of Black voters was in line with the numbers in the state during Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential race in 2016. “I believe Democrats would be concerned about the Black turnout where it is,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hoping to make sure the scales tip in their favor, Democrats are mounting a last-minute push, urging not only their loyal supporters to vote, but also reaching out to the apathetic and even chronic nonvoters, such as Ms. Wingfield.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t have to tell you the stakes,” Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate running against the incumbent, Senator David Perdue, said during in a Zoom call on Saturday with college students running a get-out-the-vote phone bank.
         </p>
         <p>
          He also announced that former President Barack Obama would be coming to Atlanta on Monday in an effort to “turn out voters and get everybody out to the polls on Election Day.”
         </p>
         <p>
          And on Saturday, Raphael G. Warnock, the pastor who is running against Senator Kelly Loeffler, was holding get-out-the-vote rallies with Democrats in DeKalb County and with South Asian voters in Suwanee, Ga.

          PHILADELPHIA — The corner of Limekiln Pike and East Pastorius Street was bustling with
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/1322574073608720386\" title=\"\">
           people bundled for a chilly day
          </a>
          of door-to-door canvassing here in northwest Philadelphia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Wearing masks with the word “vote” on them and clutching signs reading “African Americans for Biden,” they fanned out across this predominantly Black neighborhood, knocking on the doors of likely Democratic voters who had not yet returned their absentee ballots, or who hadn’t requested one at all.
         </p>
         <p>
          The city, which is the beating heart of Democratic support in this crucial battleground state, has been returning absentee ballots at a relatively high rate, with 74 percent returned as of Saturday, according to data from the U.S. Elections Project, an effort led by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          But Philadelphia, where 38 percent of registered voters requested absentee ballots, did not embrace the method as strongly as Allegheny County — home to Pittsburgh and
          
          
          the other major Democratic county in the state — where 44 percent of registered voters requested absentee ballots.
         </p>
         <p>
          Part of that is because the Democratic Party in Philadelphia
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/politics/democrats-in-person-voting.html\" title=\"\">
           began telling voters this month
          </a>
          that they should instead focus on in-person voting, and part of that is because the city has a strong Election Day voting tradition, which was evident on Saturday as canvassers knocked on numerous doors and were greeted with supportive fist pumps and pledges to vote early on Election Day.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ll be there,” said Edward Tomlin, 70, as he leaned out of his door to greet a Biden canvasser.
         </p>
         <p>
          His neighbors, members of the Griffin family, are all planning to vote in person on Election Day, including one person who will be voting for the first time.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Mr. Tomlin was told that there might be a line and he might want to bring a chair, he waved it off.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ll be fine,” he said.

          In the homestretch of the presidential election, the Biden campaign has dominated the paid media landscape.
         </p>
         <p>
          On television and radio, the Biden campaign spent $66.2 million over the past week — from Oct. 23 to Oct. 30 — while the Trump campaign spent only about $19.4 million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. The Republican National Committee has helped to pick up some of some of the Trump campaign’s slack and has run about $16 million worth of ads during the same period.
         </p>
         <p>
          The spending advantage for Democrats holds on Facebook, where the Biden campaign has spent roughly $9 million over the past week, and the Trump campaign has spent $4.4 million during the same stretch on the platform.
         </p>
         <p>
          The yawning spending gap between the two campaigns with just 72 hours to go until Election Day has persisted during the final weeks of the presidential race, as the Biden campaign has enjoyed an influx of donations at a time the Trump campaign has experienced a cash crunch.
         </p>
         <p>
          President Trump had at one point raised more than
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html\" title=\"\">

          for his re-election and had a fund-raising head start on Democrats. But

           that financial advantage has disappeared
          </a>
          , and Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered October with roughly triple the funds at his disposal as Mr. Trump: $177 million to $63.1 million. The Biden campaign has leveraged that cash advantage on the airwaves, going up with ads as Mr. Trump’s team has slashed its ad spending budget.

                    Trump’s Campaign Is Building an Army of Poll Watchers. What Can They Actually Do?

                    President Trump and his campaign have been calling for an army of poll watchers on Election Day. What is poll watching, and when does it cross the line? We look at how a federal consent decree restricted the Republican Party for decades, and why its expiration could make a difference in 2020.

                     This year, as the president has been talking about— “Fraud like you’ve never seen. They have these fake ballots. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll watchers.” “His language has taken on an almost militaristic tone.” “Go into the polls and watch very carefully. Be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.” There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections. Still, the president talks about recruiting an army of poll watchers. “It’s taken on such an aggressive nature in a way that we’ve kind of never seen before. It’s very frightening to election officials.” “It paints poll watching with a veneer of antagonism, combat and not in the spirit of protecting our elections.” But it’s more than just rhetoric. This year, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll watching operations in ways we haven’t seen for nearly 40 years. To understand why, let’s take a trip back in time — “Wherever I go, people ask me what a New Jersey vacation is like” — to a governor’s race in New Jersey in 1981. “When I ran in that election, it was a very interesting election, to say the least.” This was the Democratic candidate James Florio. And here he is now. “That’s a long time ago, that’s 40 years ago.” The race was an early referendum on the Reagan administration. “I like Tom Kean.” “Kean has endorsed Reaganomics and proposed cuts in state taxes on business. The Democratic candidate, Congressman James Florio, attacks both Reagan’s and Kean’s economic plan.” “We thought it would be an election on the merits of the issues” — “revitalizing our railroads, cleaning up toxic waste, strengthening law enforcement” — “turned out that was not all involving the merits.” It was the closest fought election in the history of the state. But as it turns out, it wasn’t a clean fight. “Election day yielded some surprises to a lot of people who went to the polls because people saw off duty policemen with armbands that said ‘members of the Ballot Security Task Force.’” “That’s the Republican group, which according to state Democrats, intimidated some minority voters.” “It looked very official. And they were standing there with their guns.” “They obstructed voters from casting ballots. But also they obstructed access by poll workers.” More than 200 task force members showed up at the polls, confronting voters in Democratic strongholds. They were in Newark but not in Short Hills. They were in Trenton but not Princeton. And Camden but not in Cherry Hill. “If you look at the demographics of the neighborhoods that were targeted for these efforts, they were all predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods. White voters were not targeted in the same way at all.” “So it was clear that they’re not concerned about ballot integrity. They’re concerned about intimidation. It was a very clever, sinister initiative.” In the end, Florio lost by a razor thin margin. “1,797 votes out of 2.3 million votes. The intimidation had an impact on the outcome of the election.” “It’s a case of sour grapes from Democrats that don’t know how to take defeat.” But this wasn’t just a local effort. Investigations suggested that the task force was organized and paid for by the Republican National Committee. “A covert operation that was at the very least intentionally misleading and resulted in technical violations of our election laws.” Democrats sued the R.N.C. for violating the Voting Rights Act. The R.N.C. was forced to enter into a federal consent decree that would restrict them for years to come. “For the better part of the past four decades, the Republican National Party has been under a consent decree that has limited their ability to coordinate some of these poll watching activities.” “So it created a mechanism that deterred any additional voter intimidation and also created a check on future R.N.C. efforts that might target minority communities.” Under the terms of the consent decree, the R.N.C. had to get court approval for poll watching plans. The party tried unsuccessfully to get out of it for many years. “And they were found to be in violation of the consent decree at least three times since it was put into place.” Then in 2017, the court allowed the consent decree to expire, setting up a different kind of fight in 2020. “This will be the first presidential election where we will see the Republican National Party operating a poll watching operation without the consent decree hovering over their heads. Now that it has been lifted, it looks like there is going to be a more organized and a bigger poll watching operation coming out of the Republican National Party.” Republicans say they’re training more than 50,000 poll watchers in at least 15 battleground states. They’ve released a series of carefully worded training presentations for volunteers. “Poll watchers are the first line of defense for President Trump. Be courteous to county staff and other watchers. Yes, even our Democrat friends. Do not speak with voters and do not interfere with the orderly conduct of the voting process.” Their presence at the polls is perfectly legal if they follow the rules. In early voting this year, there have been a few potential violations. Pennsylvania’s attorney general called out illegal surveillance of a ballot dropbox in Philadelphia. And local news in Florida reported on two armed private security guards who posted themselves near an early voting site. “Two armed security guards showed up outside of the downtown St. Pete early voting location.” “Pretty much ever since the president has been calling on his supporters to watch the polls, election officials and law enforcement agencies across the country have kind of been preparing for what may be an influx of people who don’t know the rules and regulations of poll watching.” In a statement, the R.N.C. said its poll watchers have received rigorous training to follow state laws and are not there to be intimidating. “The big unknown is exactly how big and how widespread the deployment of these poll watchers will be and whether they will have any kind of marching orders from the Republican Party or the Trump campaign to really question a bunch of voters’ eligibility or whether they’ll just kind of follow the more traditional ways.” Ultimately, the consent decree offered a legal shortcut to stop the R.N.C.’s poll watching operations if they crossed the line. “What’s important to keep in mind is that the tactics that were unlawful in 1980 are just as unlawful in 2020. There has never been permission for any political party or any private party to engage in racially targeted voter intimidation or voter intimidation of any sort. And so we’re not without protection. We’re not without tools to combat it. But we do have one less in our arsenal.” “If we see a resumption of the same type of thing this time, we’ll have to go back to court. I can be authoritatively the person that can be definitive and say that small margins make a big difference.”

          President Trump and his campaign have been calling for an army of poll watchers on Election Day. And with the expiration of a decades-old court order, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll-watching operations nationwide.
         </p>
         <p>
          The R.N.C. says its poll watchers are carefully trained, but the campaign’s rhetoric has raised fears of voter intimidation, like the kind that lead to the original court order. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee paid and organized armed, off-duty police officers to patrol polling stations in minority neighborhoods in New Jersey. Democrats sued, and got the R.N.C. to enter into a consent decree in 1982, restricting the party’s poll watching efforts for 35 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          It expired in 2017, making 2020 the first presidential election without this extra layer of protection. Voter intimidation remains illegal, but without the consent decree the main challenge is litigation, which could take years.

             The presidential race in Florida looks similar to 2016 in at least one regard: It’ll probably be close, maybe decided again by just
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\" title=\"\">
              a single percentage point
             </a>
             . But under the surface, there will be major differences in terms of who’s voting for whom.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump can count on the continued support of rural voters and white men, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. is almost guaranteed to carry strong support from women and African-American voters across the state.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Yet Mr. Biden is unlikely to hold on to Hillary Clinton’s strong showing with Latino voters. Instead, he’s looking to make up for it among some of the white voting blocs that Mr. Trump relied on in 2016, particularly suburbanites and older voters.
            </p>
            <p>
             A batch of high-quality Florida polls arrived this week — probably some of the last that we’ll see before the election — and they all showed Mr. Biden with an advantage of three to six percentage points among the state’s likely voters. Taken together, the surveys from
             <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_fl_102920.pdf/\" title=\"\">
              Monmouth University
             </a>
             ,
             <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/fl/fl10292020_crosstabs_bgth12.pdf\" title=\"\">
              Quinnipiac University
             </a>
             and
             <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NBC-News_Marist-Poll_FL-Likely-Voters_NOS-and-Tables_202010281159.pdf#page=3\" title=\"\">
              NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College
             </a>
             put Mr. Biden in a strong position to pull together a winning coalition in Florida, which has successfully predicted the victor in the past six presidential elections.
            </p>
            <p>
             In each poll, the difference was within the margin of error, and the polling miss of 2016 — when Florida surveys overestimated Mrs. Clinton’s support by a few points — should give us pause.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mr. Trump’s victory in Florida that year relied heavily on late-deciding voters, and in both the Monmouth and Marist polls, no more than 2 percent of voters said they still didn’t know how they would vote. Turnout is also on track to be considerably higher this year, which leaves less room for certain groups to under-participate, as Democratic voters did in 2016, further throwing off polls.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             The consistency of the findings from this week’s polls suggests that Mr. Trump does have ground to make up. The Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls also showed that he will be fighting the clock: In both surveys, just 17 percent of likely voters said they would vote on Election Day, with the rest planning to cast ballots early in person or by mail.

            <h2>
             The early returns
            </h2>
            <p>
             Turnout has been running high across the state, with more than seven million ballots already cast as of Thursday night. That’s nearly 80 percent of the total votes cast in 2016. After one more weekend of early voting and a few more days of mail ballots arriving, the vote tally could well surpass 2016’s total vote before Election Day even arrives.

            <p>
             Slightly more Democrats have turned out than Republicans, though only by 200,000 votes. That advantage is padded by Mr. Biden’s polling lead among independents, who have cast about one in five ballots so far.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the crosstabs from Monmouth University’s latest poll of Florida were to perfectly predict how Democrats, Republicans and independents are voting, then Mr. Biden would be winning 52 percent of early votes and Mr. Trump 43 percent, according to the
             <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/FL.html\" title=\"\">
              available voter data
             </a>
             on ballots already cast by Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Those are almost certainly not the exact real numbers, but they’re somewhere in that range.
            </p>
            <p>
             Republicans can count on a last-minute voting surge come Election Day, when they are almost certain to outnumber Democrats going to the polls. But given how many votes will have been cast by then, and since less than one in five voters are telling pollsters they plan to vote that day, it may be a steep uphill climb.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Older voters
            </h2>
            <p>
             Daniel Smith, a professor of political science and pollster at the University of Florida, has been tracking voter turnout by demographic groups, and he said he had been struck by the participation from older voters. Florida is home to vast numbers of retirees, and its diverse population of seniors is a heavily sought-after chunk of the electorate.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The senior vote has been huge so far,” Dr. Smith said, citing numbers showing that two-thirds of voters 65 and older had already voted. That is occurring in traditionally Republican areas — like Sumter County, home to the Villages, which has already matched its 2016 vote total — and more heavily Democratic ones, such as Broward County.
            </p>
           </div>

            <p>
             But the election may be won and lost in the middle, among the many older voters who cast ballots for Mr. Trump four years ago but have turned against him, and whose opposition has only been cemented by his response to the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Trump has doubled down on ‘Covid, Covid, Covid’ and the ‘hoax’ of this virus, and older voters aren’t buying it,” Dr. Smith said.

            <p>
             Yet Mr. Biden hasn’t left the president in the dust; according to the three polls this week, the candidates are roughly splitting older voters in Florida, meaning that Mr. Trump is hanging on to at least a slight majority of white seniors.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president has proved more consistently repellent to college-educated white voters across the state. These voters spurned Mrs. Clinton and supported him overwhelmingly in 2016, when he won 60 percent of white women with college degrees in Florida to Mrs. Clinton’s 37 percent, according to exit polls.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the Marist poll released on Thursday found that those numbers had more than flipped: Sixty-four percent of white, college-educated women in Florida supported Mr. Biden, and 35 percent backed Mr. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             The effect was particularly felt in the state’s suburbs, which Mr. Trump won handily in 2016 — and which largely stuck with Republicans in the 2018 midterm election, defying national trends. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll gave Mr. Biden a 14-point lead in suburban areas.
            </p>
            <h2>
             The diverse Latino population
            </h2>
            <p>
             Like most of the country, Florida tilted Democratic in 2018, with two House seats flipping blue. But in narrow races for senator and governor, Republicans eked out victories.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           <div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.84364820847\" morss_score=\"24.7821395044\">
            <p>
             Part of that was because of a drop in Democratic support among Latino voters. In 2016, 62 percent of Florida’s Latino voters broke for Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls; two years later, just 54 percent voted for the Democratic governor and Senate candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has worked to strengthen his support among Cuban-Americans in particular, and his claims that Democrats are flirting with socialism may carry a particular resonance with these voters, many of whom belong to families that fled the Castro regime. But it was not only among Cuban Latinos that Democrats’ margins suffered in 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the Democratic vote generally rose elsewhere, in the three Florida counties with
             <a href=\"https://www.floridatrend.com/article/15517/hispanic-diversity-in-florida-map\" title=\"\">
              the highest Hispanic populations
             </a>
             , it was down compared with two years earlier. One of those counties, Miami-Dade, has a high concentration of Cubans, but the others, Osceola and Hendry, are more heavily Puerto Rican and Mexican-American.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden was not the Latino community’s
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/us/politics/California-Bernie-Sanders.html\" title=\"\">
              first choice
             </a>
             in the Democratic primaries, and his lead over Mr. Trump among Latino voters has been unreliable since he became the nominee. That’s been particularly true in Florida, where some polls have shown him effectively tied with Mr. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’ve known for a while that Biden was unlikely to hit Clinton’s 2016 numbers, but the goal would be to do better than Nelson and Gillum did in 2018 and be more in line with where Obama was in 2012,” said Carlos Odio, a founder of EquisLabs, a liberal-leaning Latino research firm. That year, exit polls gave President Barack Obama a 21-point lead over Mitt Romney.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far, Mr. Biden has not managed that. Averaging together the results of the Monmouth, Marist and Quinnipiac polls this week, Mr. Biden led by just 12 points among Latinos.
            </p>
            <p>
             Latino voters now account for about one in five ballots cast in Florida, twice their share just 20 years ago.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           
            <p>
             Mr. Odio said that Democrats would seek to win over Cuban-American voters in Miami-Dade County, but that they would be largely focused on driving up turnout among the roughly seven in 10 Florida Latinos who are not Cuban.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Biden has a lot more room to grow, and these are populations where there are more late deciders,” Mr. Odio said. Latino voters are more likely than other groups to affiliate with neither party, and to be conflicted about which candidate to choose.
            </p>
            <p>
             But only a few days remain for that decision. And Florida this year intends to be efficient: While it is known for its vote-counting snafus, the state has a long history of accepting high numbers of mail-in ballots, and its election laws allow officials to begin counting them earlier than in many other states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Together with the fact that ballots must be received by Election Day in order to be counted, that means it’s possible the state could manage to declare a winner by the evening of Nov. 3, providing a powerful clue to which candidate is on track to win the presidency.
            </p>

            <p>
             On the weekend of Oct. 10, President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, his former adviser Stephen K. Bannon and a prominent new ally, a Chinese billionaire and Mar-a-Lago member named Guo Wengui, gathered at Mr. Guo’s luxury apartment overlooking Central Park for dinner and cigars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each faced some combination of legal or credibility issues, but on this night they had reason to celebrate: a plan was coming together.
            </p>
            <p>
             That weekend, Mr. Giuliani had delivered to The New York Post a copy of a hard drive purported to be from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, the son of Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The hard drive was filled with what the men claimed was compromising material about the younger Biden that they hoped would sully his father’s reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was the latest in an often-bumbling series of attacks that began two years ago with the goal of undercutting Mr. Biden as a threat to Mr. Trump’s re-election by linking him to the messy personal and business affairs of his son.

             The Post articles were quickly followed by others from Peter Schweizer, the conservative author who in 2016 had promoted unsubstantiated theories about corruption by the Clintons and who in this case was relying on material provided by a former associate of Hunter Biden who is

             While the president has promoted the material relentlessly, many of the Trump-friendly news outlets and other organizations that sustained the effort four years ago have been diminished or sidelined.

             While highlighting questions about the business activities of Hunter Biden and the former vice president’s brother James Biden, Mr. Giuliani and his allies have failed to prove that Joe Biden was involved in or a beneficiary of them.

            <p>
             As he seeks asylum, he has built bridges into Mr. Trump’s orbit. He is a member of Mr. Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Fla., Mar-a-Lago, and he is represented by a lawyer, Daniel T. Podhaskie, who had worked as an outside counsel for the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign.

            <p>
             When Mr. Bannon left the White House, Mr. Guo gave him a $150,000 loan, which Mr. Bannon later told The New York Times was related to a film project about the Chinese Communist Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon afterward, a media company associated with Mr. Guo, Guo Media,

              gave Mr. Bannon a $1 million contract
             </a>
             to introduce its executives to “media personalities” and advise it on industry standards, subjects on which Mr. Bannon had expertise as the former head of Breitbart News.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Guo’s representatives have said he is merely the face of Guo Media and not an owner, though its central property, G News, is closely identified with Mr. Guo and his cause. In April, an associated venture linked to Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon registered as a new business in New York, GTV Media, whose central hub is a Chinese-language, anti-Communist Party video platform.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a GTV video posted on Twitter in July, Mr. Guo described Mr. Bannon and Mr. Podhaskie as directors, noting their ties to Mr. Trump, though Mr. Bannon was removed from the board the next month after his arrest.

             The venture quickly raised $300 million, but as

             The media properties soon seized on a subject that represented a confluence of interest between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo — claims that Hunter Biden used his father’s name to make money from China.

               Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, was charged in August with defrauding donors to a pro-Trump initiative. He maintains his innocence. Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon began working together after Mr. Bannon left the White House in 2017.

             In September, the Guo-related media world started noting chatter about hard drives purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. In late September, the material was teased by the host of an anti-Beijing YouTube show who goes by Lu De. He is closely associated with Mr. Guo and appeared in a photograph with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bannon that was posted on G News and
             <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1304535784335249408\" title=\"\">
              later Twitter
             </a>
             shortly before he first brought up the material.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Weeks before the New York Post articles, Lu De, whose real name, according to GTV, is Wang Dinggang, claimed without evidence on his YouTube program that Chinese sources had sent “three hard disks” with damaging material about Chinese leaders and about Mr. Biden, including videos recorded by the Communist Party, to the Justice Department and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
            </p>
            <p>
             That broadcast
             <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy\" title=\"\">
              was first reported by The Daily Beast
             </a>
             , which also noted that three days later, a Twitter account associated with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo picked up that report. The tweet described “3 hard disk drives of videos and dossiers of Hunter Biden’s connections with the Chinese Communist Party” and said they had the makings of a “Big money and sex scandal!”
            </p>
            <p>
             Salacious material published on the Guo-linked sites is being picked up regularly by fringe outlets like Infowars and Gateway Pundit, providing it
             <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/inside-campaign-pizzagate-hunter-biden-n1244331\" title=\"\">
              a conduit to English-speaking audiences in the United States
             </a>
             . Those outlets, though, have faced hurdles on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms that have sought to block the explicit videos and suspend accounts circulating them.
            </p>
            <p>
             In recent days, GTV featured a notice saying it would continue to publish the videos but would “do our best” to filter graphic depictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bannon asserted that the effort to limit the spread of the New York Post’s articles on social media had backfired, drawing more attention to them. “Social media overplayed this and did us a favor,” Mr. Bannon said.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is unclear if the material featured on the sites linked to Mr. Guo is the same as that provided to The New York Post by Mr. Giuliani, which Mr. Giuliani said came from a laptop turned over to his lawyer by a computer store owner in Delaware.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Mr. Giuliani did not respond to questions about the origins of the materials featured by the Guo-linked outlets, nor did Mr. Guo’s lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             But in a statement, Mr. Guo said, “I support GTV’s efforts to make the public aware of the C.C.P.’s ability to infiltrate and gain influence in the U.S. government, the media and their families and friends through corruption, drugs and sex scandals.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He also said he had “not been involved in providing any information to The N.Y. Post regarding this story.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bannon said that Mr. Guo had not been connected to the acquisition of the hard drive that Mr. Bannon helped Mr. Giuliani provide to The New York Post.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mr. Bannon acknowledged that he pushes content to GTV, which also carries his podcast, War Room.

               The effort to use material about Hunter Biden to undercut his father’s campaign in the closing stages of the election extended beyond Mr. Giuliani to a loose network of conservatives.

             At the same time Mr. Bannon and Mr. Giuliani were shopping the purported hard drive, two other efforts were afoot to disseminate related information on Hunter Biden.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             In one, Mr. Schweizer had obtained a cache of emails from Bevan Cooney, the former Hunter Biden associate who is in prison for fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             Using those emails, Mr. Schweizer and a researcher for his watchdog group, the Government Accountability Institute, have published several stories, including one trying to draw a link between Hunter Biden’s dealings in China and his associates’ efforts to arrange meetings in Washington for Chinese business leaders during the Obama administration.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Schweizer’s institute, of which Mr. Bannon was a co-founder, has received funding from Ms. Mercer’s family, according to tax records. The Mercers have also provided funding to Breitbart News, which was
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/steve-bannon-breitbart-trump.html\" title=\"\">
              previously run by Mr. Bannon
             </a>
             and which has been publishing Mr. Schweizer’s articles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, Mr. Schweizer was consulted in September about the claims made by Mr. Bobulinski, who had worked in 2017 with Hunter and James Biden on a joint venture with a Chinese conglomerate that fizzled.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to two people familiar with the events, Mr. Bobulinski, an investor who had done business related to China, had approached allies of Mr. Trump, seeking assistance to publicize his claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bobulinski, who was admittedly bitter about the way the proposed deal unraveled, was referred to Mr. Passantino, who previously worked in the White House Counsel’s Office and works with a campaign-affiliated group, Lawyers for Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an effort to vet Mr. Bobulinski’s claims and documents, Mr. Passantino was referred by Mr. Gingrich, a longtime client, to Mr. Schweizer, who wrote a book in 2018 about business dealings involving Hunter Biden in Ukraine, China and elsewhere.

             Mr. Passantino “just asked advice,” Mr. Gingrich said. “And I said, ‘Look, the guy who knows the most about this is Schweizer,’ so I sent him Schweizer’s email address.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Passantino and Mr. Bobulinski met with Mr. Schweizer in September to review the materials, and Mr. Schweizer said they comported with his own research.
            </p>
            <p>
             Armed with that assurance, Mr. Passantino and Mr. Herschmann, who had worked first as a private lawyer for Mr. Trump, then as a member of the impeachment defense team and more recently as a West Wing official,
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/business/media/hunter-biden-wall-street-journal-trump.html\" title=\"\">
              attended a meeting in Virginia
             </a>
             to provide Mr. Bobulinski’s documents and outline his claims to a reporter from The Wall Street Journal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bobulinski has asserted that the former vice president was aware of, and stood to potentially profit from, the joint venture. Mr. Bobulinski says he met twice with the former vice president after he left office.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Journal

              dug into Mr. Bobulinski’s account
             </a>
             , and in the end reported that corporate records showed “no role for Joe Biden” in the deal and that the documents provided by Mr. Bobulinski “don’t show either Hunter Biden or James Biden discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, Mr. Gingrich, who posted a video this week highlighting some of the material, says it has resonated with Mr. Trump’s supporters, adding that if “you want to maximize your turnout, this is not a bad way to do it.”

             YIWU, China — Deep inside a 10-block-long factory outlet mall in China, the people who supply Americans with their plastic dinosaurs and “Kiss My Bass” baseball caps are confident about a Nov. 3 victory for Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump’s campaign paraphernalia — hats, banners, mugs and practically anything else that can carry a logo — has been selling briskly at shops in the vast wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu. By contrast, shop owners said during recent visits, bulk orders for materials supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have been almost nonexistent.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’ve had four or five shoppers for Trump materials each month,” said Ge Lu, a salesman at one of about 100 shops specializing just in flags, referring to big purchasers who buy banners by the thousands. “We’ve had one Biden shopper this year.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The place isn’t for the average shopper. Yiwu is home to the world’s largest wholesale market, where global retailers look for items to stock on their own shelves. In building after cavernous building, buyers for companies big and small pick through stalls featuring hats, T-shirts, banners, face masks, baby toys, knapsacks, modeling clay and practically any other manufactured product that will delight the world’s fickle consumers.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             It is also home to what Chinese watchers of American politics — a nervous group these days, given souring relations between the two countries and Beijing’s tighter limits on conversation — call the Yiwu Index. Big demand for a presidential candidate’s merchandise, goes the theory, translates into big voter turnout in November.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now, according to the informal and highly unscientific index, Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden substantially.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Trump still has the better chance,” said Zhang Zhijiang, the owner of a caps and hats factory in Jiangsu Province who keeps a sales office in the Yiwu market.

             Followers of the Yiwu Index believe it is reliable, however, and they have history on their side. In 2016, the index consistently predicted a Trump victory. In the final weeks of the campaign, demand for Hillary Clinton hats and other souvenirs weakened considerably.

             China is watching the election nervously. Mr. Trump launched a trade war against Beijing and has taken a more confrontational approach on issues like high-tech export controls, industrial espionage, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, some in China expect little improvement under a Biden administration. They worry that Mr. Biden might even

             Formally named the Yiwu International Trade City, it boasts 12 times the floor space of the Empire State Building, making it look like a small city. Much of the complex was hastily and even shoddily built two decades ago, giving its prematurely aging buildings a ramshackle look.

             It has 70,000 shops, and transactions taking place under its many roofs exceed $60 billion a year. The national government considers the market enough of an indicator of the health of light manufacturing that it manages its own Yiwu Index, of average prices at the shops.

             With some disorderly exceptions, floors are organized by type of merchandise. The warren-like corridors of one floor were devoted to hats. A second housed flags. A third floor featured costumes and masks, while another was devoted to toys.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ms. Dai, the owner of the baseball cap factory in Qingdao, rents a stall on the hat floor. She said orders for Trump baseball caps had been consistently strong for two years. Biden cap orders were negligible until he became the expected Democratic nominee last spring, but only in recent weeks have these customers wanted to put down cash, she added. The recent orders arrived too late to make and deliver the hats before the election.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the total for Trump cap orders so far this year: “There are tens of thousands this year,” Ms. Dai said. “Biden has a few thousand.”

             Despite its accuracy in 2016, the Yiwu political index has its flaws. Often the buyers are not the campaigns themselves but proxies, like companies and other institutions that want to express their support for a candidate, or simply stores that want to sell popular merchandise.
            </p>
            <p>
             The pandemic has interfered with normal marketing. China has barred practically all international visitors since the end of March, and it has required stringent, two-week quarantines for those who do enter. This has reduced overall activity compared with the 2016 presidential campaign, merchants said.

             The pandemic has also produced different styles of campaigning. Mr. Trump has emphasized large gatherings, with supporters waving pennants and wearing various campaign merchandise, which increases demand for goods from Yiwu. Mr. Biden has avoided holding or encouraging mass gatherings in person and has relied more on online events.
            </p>
            <p>
             As in 2016, Mr. Trump also appears to be gaining a considerable share of his support from people in rural areas, where people may have more room for yard signs and banners. Mr. Biden has done better in cities, where apartment dwellers have less room to wave flags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some vendors think Mr. Biden’s supporters may simply be taking business elsewhere. Mr. Zhang, the hat factory owner in Jiangsu Province, said Biden supporters appeared to be placing more of their baseball cap orders in Vietnam and Myanmar.
            </p>
            <p>
             With trade with the United States increasingly in doubt, a few Yiwu vendors said they were becoming less interested in the American market. In the flag section, some appeared to be appealing instead to China’s rising nationalism. On the flag floor, the corridors were a scarlet sea of red national flags, red Chinese Communist Party pennants and other souvenirs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet Trump paraphernalia is still in demand. At a Halloween mask factory outlet, rubbery Trump masks were consistently popular and completely sold out.
            </p>
            <p>
             The factory created a Biden mask, said Gigi Zhang, the store manager, but nobody had ordered it yet.

Russia intervened militarily in Ukraine in 2014, annexing the Crimean Peninsula and fomenting separatist uprisings in two eastern provinces, leading to the deaths of about 13,000 people.</p><p>Given the stakes for Ukraine, the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky has decided not to rely wholly on the U.S.-led negotiations.

The first point, the cease-fire, has already been<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/welcoming-the-ceasefire-in-donbas/\" title=\"\"> implemented</a>.</p><p>The political matters involve direct talks between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin and a final point, No. 10, under which the Ukrainian government would submit to Parliament laws granting self-rule to separatist areas and devolving some powers to these areas, according to Kommersant.</p><h4>Understand Russia’s Relationship With the West</h4><p>The tension between the regions is growing and Russian President Vladimir Putin is increasingly willing to take geopolitical risks and assert his demands.</p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Competing for Influence</strong><strong>: </strong>The threat of confrontation is growing in a <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/2021/11/19/world/europe/russia-putin-belarus-ukraine.html\">stretch of Europe from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.</a></li><li><strong>Threat of Invasion: </strong>As the Russian military builds its presence near Ukraine, the United States <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military-biden.html\">is cautiously moving to support Kyiv</a>.</li><li><strong>Energy Politics: </strong>An explosion in gas prices in Europe has led to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/30/world/europe/russia-gas-pipeline-nordstream-putin.html\">accusations that the Kremlin is restricting gas supplies</a> for political purposes.</li><li><strong>Migrant Crisis: </strong>As people gathered on the eastern border of the European Union, Russia's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/world/europe/lukashenko-putin-belarus-russia.html\">uneasy alliance with Belarus triggered additional friction</a>.</li><li><strong>Militarizing Society: </strong>With a “youth army” and initiatives promoting patriotism, the Russian government is pushing the idea that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/world/europe/russia-military-putin-kremlin.html\">a fight might be coming</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In the Russian interpretation, these laws would grant its proxies in eastern Ukraine veto power over foreign policy decisions by the central government, including NATO membership for Ukraine, potentially satisfying enough of Russia’s request to forestall a catastrophic war in Ukraine.</p><p>Western diplomats say the proposed laws leave wiggle room for interpretation, and that Mr. Zelensky is unlikely to grant Moscow veto power over future NATO membership.

But how worried should we be?</p><p>We spoke to experts to better understand what it could mean to test positive for both infections. Here’s what to keep in mind.</p><p><strong>Will co-infection make me twice as sick?</strong></p><p>A co-infection doesn’t immediately mean that a patient will be doubly sick. A strong immune response may actually help the body fight off pathogens of all types, so one infection could stimulate some additional protection.</p><p>“An infection to one might help to aid your immune response to another,” Dr. Grein said, “because it’s activating that same immune response that’s going to be effective in fighting both.”</p><p>Still, scientists don’t know for sure yet, because so few people have tested positive for both Covid-19 and influenza. But judging from past trends, doctors are not overly worried.</p><p><strong>Who is most susceptible?</strong></p><p>Dr. Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, identified two groups he thought could be most vulnerable to co-infection.</p><p>First: unvaccinated adults. “Based on previous work on vaccinations, people who refuse one vaccine might refuse others as well,” he said. He said he expected there to be a “significant overlap between people who refuse both vaccines.”</p><p>Second: children, especially those under 5, who are too young to get vaccinated against Covid. Kids are also petri dishes, as any parent will tell you, and have lived through fewer cycles of the flu. So even if a child got a flu shot, Dr. Omer said, “their library of protection is narrow” against the many viral flu strains that can emerge each year.</p><p><strong>How can I prevent co-infection?</strong></p><p>On this one, the medical advice remains consistent: Get vaccinated for both Covid and flu. And get vaccinated right now.</p><p>Both kids and adults can get both vaccines at the same time. Children ages 5 years and older are eligible for a Covid vaccine, and children older than 6 months can get vaccinated against the flu.</p><p>In addition, experts agree you should wear masks and maintain social distancing measures when appropriate. Both flu and the coronavirus are airborne viruses, so limiting your exposure cuts down on your chances of getting infected.</p><p><span>— </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/amelia-nierenberg\">Amelia Nierenberg</a> </p></div><h3>Advertisement</h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#after-dfp-ad-mid3\">Continue reading the main story</a><div data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" class=\"live-blog-post css-1fi223v\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#figure-skating-olympic-team\" data-source-id=\"100000008151714\" morss_own_score=\"4.594059405940594\" morss_score=\"50.07754563050304\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#figure-skating-olympic-team\">After U.S. figure skaters tested positive, new worries arise for the Winter Olympics.</a></h2><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Mariah Bell’s victory at the U.S. national championships on Friday secured her a spot on the American Olympic team.</span><span>Credit...</span><span>Matthew Stockman/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>U.S. Figure Skating on Saturday announced the women’s team heading to Beijing for the Winter Olympics next month.

The first infections were <a href=\"http://www.tj.gov.cn/sy/tjxw/202201/t20220109_5774754.html\" title=\"\">confirmed on Saturday</a>, in a 10-year-old girl and a 29-year-old woman who works at an after-school center.

But even with the country’s enormous resources for testing residents and tracing their movements, getting a handle on the outbreak in Tianjin might not be easy.</p><p>Zhang Ying, deputy director of the Tianjin Center for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=\"https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2022/1/472267.shtm\" title=\"\">said at a news conference</a> that the virus may have “been already spreading in the community for some time” before detection. Neither the 29-year old woman nor the 10-year old girl who tested positive had recently left Tianjin.</p><p>Government experts also said the Omicron strain found in the two Tianjin residents might not be the same as that found in recent international arrivals in the city.</p><p>Many Chinese people have been proud that their country, since quelling the world’s first outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, has avoided the waves of infections that have swept most of the world. But the authoritarian state’s stringent controls, which have kept China largely sealed off, have not been able to keep the virus out entirely, and the extreme contagiousness of Omicron could present a new level of danger.</p><p>The Tianjin authorities ordered residents to limit their travel and not to leave the city unless absolutely necessary.

But the local assembly elections in five states, representing a population of about 250 million, would proceed as planned starting in February, the commission said.</p><p>India <a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1788651\" title=\"\">recorded 160,000</a> known cases on Sunday, with the number of new cases rising sixfold in one week.

About half of the more than 180 million eligible voters across the five states are fully vaccinated, and more than 80 percent have received one dose, he said.</p><p>The spread of a new wave fueled by Omicron has mirrored that of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-oxygen.html\" title=\"\">the Delta wave</a> that ravaged India in the spring, which also began in major cities before trickling to the rest of the country. Scientists are concerned that a repeat of that pattern in the coming weeks could coincide with preparations for elections. Already, the <a href=\"https://theprint.in/health/covid-r-value-in-india-shoots-up-to-1-96-highest-since-the-beginning-of-the-pandemic/794781/\" title=\"\">virus’s reproduction rate</a> seems to be increasing in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the two most populous of the states up for elections.</p><p>The true number of infections was likely undercounted in official data as a large number of the infected people were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and did not test.</p><p>The number of tests have increased in recent days, particularly in major cities. Nationwide, nearly one in every 10 test is returning positive. Some areas, including the city of Kolkata, had a test positivity rate of more than 50 percent. Fewer patients appear to be requiring hospitalization, compared to the spring wave. But health experts remain concerned that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/world/asia/india-omicron-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">the fast rate of spread</a>, with Omicron managing to infect even the vaccinated, could still <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/over-750-doctors-delhi-hospitals-covid-positive-7713827/\" title=\"\">overwhelm the health system</a>.</p><p>New Delhi remained locked down for the weekend, as security forces operated a strict curfew. Several other states and cities across India are also enforcing nighttime curfews and movement limits. In Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, officials moved to impose movement restrictions on Sunday. But it caused a crowded rush on shopping centers on Saturday, as people tried to squeeze in last-minute shopping ahead of a local harvest festival.</p><p><span>— </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/mujib-mashal\">Mujib Mashal</a> </p></div><div data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" class=\"live-blog-post css-1fi223v\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#americans-grapple-with-the-disruptions-caused-by-omicrons-strength\" data-source-id=\"100000008151568\" morss_own_score=\"4.679611650485437\" morss_score=\"31.00630882461385\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#americans-grapple-with-the-disruptions-caused-by-omicrons-strength\">Americans grapple with the disruptions caused by Omicron’s strength.</a></h2><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Waiting in line for up to two hours at McGolrick Park in Greenpoint in Brooklyn, to receive a free at-home coronavirus test kit last month.</span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sarah Blesener for The New York Times</span></figcaption></figure><p>CHICAGO — With infection rates mounting, the Omicron variant <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/09/us/united-states-covid-pandemic-omicron.html\" title=\"\">has ushered in a new and disorienting phase of the pandemic</a>, leaving Americans frustrated and dismayed that the basic elements they thought they understood about the coronavirus are shifting faster than ever.</p><p>There were reasons for heightened concern and reasons for consolation: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant.html\" title=\"\">Omicron</a> is more transmissible than previous variants, yet it appears to cause milder symptoms in many people.

But how worried should we be?</p><p>We spoke to experts to better understand what it could mean to test positive for both infections. Here’s what to keep in mind.</p><p><strong>Will co-infection make me twice as sick?</strong></p><p>A co-infection doesn’t immediately mean that a patient will be doubly sick. A strong immune response may actually help the body fight off pathogens of all types, so one infection could stimulate some additional protection.</p><p>“An infection to one might help to aid your immune response to another,” Dr. Grein said, “because it’s activating that same immune response that’s going to be effective in fighting both.”</p><p>Still, scientists don’t know for sure yet, because so few people have tested positive for both Covid-19 and influenza. But judging from past trends, doctors are not overly worried.</p><p><strong>Who is most susceptible?</strong></p><p>Dr. Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, identified two groups he thought could be most vulnerable to co-infection.</p><p>First: unvaccinated adults. “Based on previous work on vaccinations, people who refuse one vaccine might refuse others as well,” he said. He said he expected there to be a “significant overlap between people who refuse both vaccines.”</p><p>Second: children, especially those under 5, who are too young to get vaccinated against Covid. Kids are also petri dishes, as any parent will tell you, and have lived through fewer cycles of the flu. So even if a child got a flu shot, Dr. Omer said, “their library of protection is narrow” against the many viral flu strains that can emerge each year.</p><p><strong>How can I prevent co-infection?</strong></p><p>On this one, the medical advice remains consistent: Get vaccinated for both Covid and flu. And get vaccinated right now.</p><p>Both kids and adults can get both vaccines at the same time. Children ages 5 years and older are eligible for a Covid vaccine, and children older than 6 months can get vaccinated against the flu.</p><p>In addition, experts agree you should wear masks and maintain social distancing measures when appropriate. Both flu and the coronavirus are airborne viruses, so limiting your exposure cuts down on your chances of getting infected.</p><p><span>— </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/amelia-nierenberg\">Amelia Nierenberg</a> </p></div><h3>Advertisement</h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#after-dfp-ad-mid3\">Continue reading the main story</a><div data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" class=\"live-blog-post css-1fi223v\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#figure-skating-olympic-team\" data-source-id=\"100000008151714\" morss_own_score=\"4.594059405940594\" morss_score=\"50.07754563050304\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests#figure-skating-olympic-team\">After U.S. figure skaters tested positive, new worries arise for the Winter Olympics.</a></h2><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Mariah Bell’s victory at the U.S. national championships on Friday secured her a spot on the American Olympic team.</span><span>Credit...</span><span>Matthew Stockman/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>U.S. Figure Skating on Saturday announced the women’s team heading to Beijing for the Winter Olympics next month.

Nigro.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">He added that “the smoke conditions in this building were unprecedented,” and that victims had suffered from severe smoke inhalation.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Crews entering the building found victims “on every floor” and were taking them out in “cardiac and respiratory arrest,” he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">“The numbers are horrific,” Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon, adding, “This is going to be one of the worst fires that we have witnessed during modern times.”</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">A total of 63 people were injured, and those with life-threatening injuries were taken to five Bronx hospitals. Roughly 200 firefighters battled the blaze, officials said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">The cause of the fire was not immediately clear on Sunday. Commissioner Nigro said the door to the apartment where the fire started was left open, which helped fuel the fire and allowed the smoke to spread. “We’ve spread the word, ‘close the door, close the door,’” to keep a fire contained, he said.</p><p>The 120-unit building, at 333 East 181st Street near Tiebout Avenue, was built in 1972, according to city records.</p><p>About 25 windows facing Webster Avenue were blown out. Sheets hung from some of the windows, billowing in the wind.</p><p>Officials said the fire called to mind the fire at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/nyregion/julio-gonzalez-arsonist-who-killed-87-at-new-york-club-in-90-dies-at-61.html\" title=\"\">Happy Land nightclub</a> in 1990 in the Bronx, which killed 87 people. The club, which operated illegally, had no sprinklers, and several exits were blocked off with roll-down security shutters.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">That fire was set deliberately by Julio Gonzalez, who had gotten into an argument with his girlfriend who worked as a ticket taker and coat checker at the club. A bouncer had kicked Mr. Gonzalez out of the club. He returned with a dollar’s worth of gasoline, poured it across the club’s only entrance, and ignited it.</p><p>The deadliest fire in the city’s history was in 1911, at the <a href=\"https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/100-years-later-examining-the-impact-of-the-triangle-shirtwaist-factory-fire/\" title=\"\">Triangle Shirtwaist Company</a> factory in Lower Manhattan, where 146 people died.

When he got the window open, he started screaming to firefighters helping a family in apartment 3M. They couldn’t get to them just yet, he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Mr. Patterson said he had to keep opening and shutting the window to keep smoke from pouring in as he called for help.</p><p>“I was yelling, ‘Please help me! Please come get us!’” he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The family considered going out the front door because it was taking so long, but when they tried to open the door, the apartment flooded with even more smoke.</p><p> “I was thinking about my son, and I was wondering if I was ever going to see him again,” Mr. Patterson said. </p><p>It was around 11:20 a.m. that Mr. Patterson said he and his family were pulled out of the window by firefighters. </p><p>“I’m glad we made it out safe, but I still can’t believe it happened,” he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The Wague family stood on the corner of Tiebout Ave. and Folin St., huddled together, some of them under a blanket, after escaping their third floor apartment. </p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Mamadou Wague, the father, was woken up by one of his children on Sunday morning. “I get up, and there’s smoke in the kids’ rooms,” Mr. Wague, 47, said. </p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">As the family rushed out of the apartment, one of Mr. Wague’s children cried that their sister, Nafisha, 8, was missing. Mr. Wague sprinted to her room and found his daughter sitting on her bed screaming as the fire engulfed her mattress, he said. “I just grab her and run,” Mr. Wague said. He later realized his lips and nose were burned by the flames. “I didn’t think about anything except getting her out.”</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Hame Wague, Mr. Wague’s 16-year-old son, described the terror the family faced as they escaped. “It was dark in the hallway. We were all coughing,” Hame Wague said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">As he stood with his family on the corner, Hame Wague looked toward the building and thought of those who did not make it. “My heart goes out to them,” he said. </p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">By 3:30 p.m., the fire was under control, and a faint smell of smoke lingered in the air. Several residents stood nearby. Some wore sneakers, others had winter coats, and a few had blankets wrapped around their shoulders. A few people were huddled under nearby scaffolding to escape the biting wind. Several held their phones close to their faces to assure concerned family members they were alive.</p><p><span>— </span><span>Chelsia Rose Marcius</span> </p></div><h3>Advertisement</h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/nyregion/bronx-fire#after-dfp-ad-mid1\">Continue reading the main story</a><div data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" class=\"live-blog-post css-1fi223v\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/nyregion/bronx-fire#investigators-focus-on-cause-of-deadly-fire-in-a-bronx-apartment-building\" data-source-id=\"100000008152297\" morss_own_score=\"5.339805825242719\" morss_score=\"40.33980582524272\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/nyregion/bronx-fire#investigators-focus-on-cause-of-deadly-fire-in-a-bronx-apartment-building\">Investigators focus on cause of deadly fire in a Bronx apartment building.</a></h2><figure class=\"img-sz-large css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\" morss_own_score=\"6.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\"><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>The fire began on the second and third floors of the building, on East 181st Street.</span><span>Credit...</span><span>David Dee Delgado for The New York Times</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The fire that tore through a Bronx apartment building on Sunday was full of working class residents, including some from Latin America and Africa, according to local politicians.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The blaze started just before 11 a.m. in a duplex apartment on the second and third floors of the building, on East 181st Street, according to the Fire Department.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">Fire investigators had not yet determined the cause of the fire or why it spread so quickly. It sent flames and smoke throughout the 19-story building, said Oswald Feliz, the city councilman. The building had 120 units, including studios to four-bedroom apartments. The Department of Building sent inspectors to conduct a structural stability inspection of the building.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">The building, Twin Parks North West, is home to working class families, many of who depend on Section 8 rental assistance. Some victims were found trapped in the stairwells and others in their apartments, and one man narrowly escaped when the elevator arrived as he was losing consciousness, Mr. Feliz said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The specific vouchers they use in the development are not transferable, Mr. Feliz said, adding that it would be difficult for them to find permanent housing.</p><p>“It’s a tragedy,” he said. “We’re talking about some of the poorest New Yorkers.”</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">The Bronx building is owned by Camber Property Group, a developer of affordable housing properties in New York City, most of which are in the Bronx.

</section><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">At least 19 people, including nine children, were killed in a fire in a Bronx apartment building on Sunday morning, according to a city official who was not authorized to speak publicly, in what officials described as one of the city’s worst fires in recent memory.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The fire started just before 11 a.m. in a duplex apartment on the second and third floors of the building, on East 181st Street, according to the Fire Department.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Firefighters arrived within three minutes and encountered smoke that extended the entire height of the 19-story building, said the fire commissioner, Daniel A. Nigro.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">He added that “the smoke conditions in this building were unprecedented,” and that victims had suffered from severe smoke inhalation.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Crews entering the building found victims “on every floor” and were taking them out in “cardiac and respiratory arrest,” he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">“The numbers are horrific,” Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon, adding, “This is going to be one of the worst fires that we have witnessed during modern times.”</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">A total of 63 people were injured, and those with life-threatening injuries were taken to five Bronx hospitals. Roughly 200 firefighters battled the blaze, officials said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">The cause of the fire was not immediately clear on Sunday. Commissioner Nigro said the door to the apartment where the fire started was left open, which helped fuel the fire and allowed the smoke to spread. “We’ve spread the word, ‘close the door, close the door,’” to keep a fire contained, he said.</p><p>The 120-unit building, at 333 East 181st Street near Tiebout Avenue, was built in 1972, according to city records.</p><p>About 25 windows facing Webster Avenue were blown out. Sheets hung from some of the windows, billowing in the wind.</p><p>Officials said the fire called to mind the fire at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/nyregion/julio-gonzalez-arsonist-who-killed-87-at-new-york-club-in-90-dies-at-61.html\" title=\"\">Happy Land nightclub</a> in 1990 in the Bronx, which killed 87 people. The club, which operated illegally, had no sprinklers, and several exits were blocked off with roll-down security shutters.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">That fire was set deliberately by Julio Gonzalez, who had gotten into an argument with his girlfriend who worked as a ticket taker and coat checker at the club. A bouncer had kicked Mr. Gonzalez out of the club. He returned with a dollar’s worth of gasoline, poured it across the club’s only entrance, and ignited it.</p><p>The deadliest fire in the city’s history was in 1911, at the <a href=\"https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/100-years-later-examining-the-impact-of-the-triangle-shirtwaist-factory-fire/\" title=\"\">Triangle Shirtwaist Company</a> factory in Lower Manhattan, where 146 people died.

When he got the window open, he started screaming to firefighters helping a family in apartment 3M. They couldn’t get to them just yet, he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Mr. Patterson said he had to keep opening and shutting the window to keep smoke from pouring in as he called for help.</p><p>“I was yelling, ‘Please help me! Please come get us!’” he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The family considered going out the front door because it was taking so long, but when they tried to open the door, the apartment flooded with even more smoke.</p><p> “I was thinking about my son, and I was wondering if I was ever going to see him again,” Mr. Patterson said. </p><p>It was around 11:20 a.m. that Mr. Patterson said he and his family were pulled out of the window by firefighters. </p><p>“I’m glad we made it out safe, but I still can’t believe it happened,” he said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The Wague family stood on the corner of Tiebout Ave. and Folin St., huddled together, some of them under a blanket, after escaping their third floor apartment. </p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Mamadou Wague, the father, was woken up by one of his children on Sunday morning. “I get up, and there’s smoke in the kids’ rooms,” Mr. Wague, 47, said. </p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">As the family rushed out of the apartment, one of Mr. Wague’s children cried that their sister, Nafisha, 8, was missing. Mr. Wague sprinted to her room and found his daughter sitting on her bed screaming as the fire engulfed her mattress, he said. “I just grab her and run,” Mr. Wague said. He later realized his lips and nose were burned by the flames. “I didn’t think about anything except getting her out.”</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Hame Wague, Mr. Wague’s 16-year-old son, described the terror the family faced as they escaped. “It was dark in the hallway. We were all coughing,” Hame Wague said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">As he stood with his family on the corner, Hame Wague looked toward the building and thought of those who did not make it. “My heart goes out to them,” he said. </p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">By 3:30 p.m., the fire was under control, and a faint smell of smoke lingered in the air. Several residents stood nearby. Some wore sneakers, others had winter coats, and a few had blankets wrapped around their shoulders. A few people were huddled under nearby scaffolding to escape the biting wind. Several held their phones close to their faces to assure concerned family members they were alive.</p><p><span>— </span><span>Chelsia Rose Marcius</span> </p></div><h3>Advertisement</h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/nyregion/bronx-fire#after-dfp-ad-mid1\">Continue reading the main story</a><div data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" class=\"live-blog-post css-1fi223v\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/nyregion/bronx-fire#investigators-focus-on-cause-of-deadly-fire-in-a-bronx-apartment-building\" data-source-id=\"100000008152297\" morss_own_score=\"5.339805825242719\" morss_score=\"40.33980582524272\"><h2><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/09/nyregion/bronx-fire#investigators-focus-on-cause-of-deadly-fire-in-a-bronx-apartment-building\">Investigators focus on cause of deadly fire in a Bronx apartment building.</a></h2><figure class=\"img-sz-large css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\" morss_own_score=\"6.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\"><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>The fire began on the second and third floors of the building, on East 181st Street.</span><span>Credit...</span><span>David Dee Delgado for The New York Times</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The fire that tore through a Bronx apartment building on Sunday was full of working class residents, including some from Latin America and Africa, according to local politicians.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The blaze started just before 11 a.m. in a duplex apartment on the second and third floors of the building, on East 181st Street, according to the Fire Department.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">Fire investigators had not yet determined the cause of the fire or why it spread so quickly. It sent flames and smoke throughout the 19-story building, said Oswald Feliz, the city councilman. The building had 120 units, including studios to four-bedroom apartments. The Department of Building sent inspectors to conduct a structural stability inspection of the building.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">The building, Twin Parks North West, is home to working class families, many of who depend on Section 8 rental assistance. Some victims were found trapped in the stairwells and others in their apartments, and one man narrowly escaped when the elevator arrived as he was losing consciousness, Mr. Feliz said.</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"9.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">The specific vouchers they use in the development are not transferable, Mr. Feliz said, adding that it would be difficult for them to find permanent housing.</p><p>“It’s a tragedy,” he said. “We’re talking about some of the poorest New Yorkers.”</p><p class=\"live-blog-post-content css-1i6lz47 evys1bk0\" morss_own_score=\"10.0\" morss_score=\"10.0\">The Bronx building is owned by Camber Property Group, a developer of affordable housing properties in New York City, most of which are in the Bronx. The company’s co-founder, Rick Gropper, was named as a member of Eric Adam’s transition team for housing issues before Mr. Adams took office this month.

Baker III’s Words on NATO Loom in Ukraine Standoff" "<section name=\"articleBody\" class=\"meteredContent css-1r7ky0e\" morss_own_score=\"9.001413094677343\" morss_score=\"30.239814604117534\"><p>WASHINGTON — When officials from Russia and the United States sit down in Geneva on Monday for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/09/world/europe/russia-ukraine-us-geneva.html\" title=\"\">high-profile discussions</a> with another war in Europe on the line, hovering over the talks will be an American diplomat who will not even be in the room.</p><p>Nearly 30 years after James A. Baker III stepped down as secretary of state, the current confrontation over Ukraine turns in part on a long-running argument about what, if any, commitments he made to Moscow in the waning days of the Cold War and whether the United States fulfilled them.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin and other Russian officials have asserted that Mr. Baker ruled out NATO expansion into Eastern Europe when he served as President George H.W. Bush’s top diplomat. The West’s failure to live up to that agreement, in this argument, is the real cause of the crisis now gripping Europe as Mr. Putin demands that NATO forswear membership for Ukraine as the price of calling off a potential invasion.</p><p>But the record suggests this is a selective account of what really happened, used to justify Russian aggression for years. While there was indeed discussion between Mr. Baker and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the months after the fall of the Berlin Wall about limiting NATO jurisdiction if East and West Germany were reunited, no such provision was included in the final treaty signed by the Americans, Europeans and Russians.</p><p>“The bottom line is, that’s a ridiculous argument,” Mr. Baker said in an interview in 2014, a few months after Russia seized Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine. “It is true that in the initial stages of negotiations I said ‘what if’ and then Gorbachev himself supported a solution that extended the border that included the German Democratic Republic,” or East Germany, within NATO. Since the Russians signed that treaty, he asked, how can they rely “on something I said a month or so before? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>In fact, while Mr. Putin accuses the United States of breaking an agreement it never made, Russia has violated an agreement it actually did make with regard to Ukraine. In 1994, after the Soviet Union broke apart, Russia signed an accord along with the United States and Britain called the Budapest Memorandum, in which the newly independent Ukraine gave up 1,900 nuclear warheads in exchange for a commitment from Moscow “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” and “to refrain from the threat or use of force” against the country.</p><p>Russia trampled Ukrainian sovereignty when it annexed Crimea and sponsored proxy forces to wage war against the Kyiv government in eastern Ukraine. And it is once again threatening the use of force by assembling 100,000 Russian troops along its border to extract guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO.</p><p>The dispute traces back to the final years of the Cold War, when East and West were negotiating the framework of what Mr. Bush would call the new world order. The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, led to negotiations over unifying the two Germanys formed after World War II.</p><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Mr. Baker served as President George H.W.

On Jan. 31, 1990, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said in a speech that there would not be “an expansion of NATO territory to the east, in other words, closer to the borders of the Soviet Union.”</p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.7068181818181816\" morss_score=\"25.665751515151516\"><p>He was talking about whether NATO troops would be stationed in territory then constituting East Germany, not whether other countries would eventually be considered for membership in the alliance.

The word “jurisdiction” could imply that the NATO doctrine of collective defense would apply only to part of German territory, limiting German sovereignty. It was one thing to agree not to move troops into the East right away, as far as American officials were concerned, but all of Germany had to be part of NATO.</p><p>“The N.S.C. got to him pretty quickly and said that language might be misinterpreted,” Condoleezza Rice, then a Soviet adviser to Mr. Bush and later secretary of state under President George W.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany likewise rejected Mr. Genscher’s formulation.</p></div><p>“I may have been a little bit forward on my skis on that, but they changed it and he knew that they changed it,” Mr. Baker recalled of Mr. Gorbachev. “He never once again in all the months that followed ever raised the question of NATO expanding its jurisdiction eastward.

The final treaty unifying Germany later in 1990 barred foreign troops from the old East Germany, but German troops assigned to NATO could be deployed there once Soviet forces withdrew by the end of 1994. Nothing in the treaty addressed NATO expansion beyond that.</p><p>“Now remember, it’s not clear the Soviet Union is going to collapse at this point,” Dr. Rice recalled. “It’s not even clear that the Warsaw Pact is going to collapse. This is about the unification of Germany.” She added, “The expansion of NATO was just not on the table as an issue in ’90-’91.”</p><p>No less a witness agreed than Mr. Gorbachev. “The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years,” <a href=\"https://www.rbth.com/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html\" title=\"\">he told an interviewer</a> after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine seven years ago.

Baker III stepped down as secretary of state, the current confrontation over Ukraine turns in part on a long-running argument about what, if any, commitments he made to Moscow in the waning days of the Cold War and whether the United States fulfilled them.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin and other Russian officials have asserted that Mr. Baker ruled out NATO expansion into Eastern Europe when he served as President George H.W. Bush’s top diplomat. The West’s failure to live up to that agreement, in this argument, is the real cause of the crisis now gripping Europe as Mr. Putin demands that NATO forswear membership for Ukraine as the price of calling off a potential invasion.</p><p>But the record suggests this is a selective account of what really happened, used to justify Russian aggression for years. While there was indeed discussion between Mr. Baker and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the months after the fall of the Berlin Wall about limiting NATO jurisdiction if East and West Germany were reunited, no such provision was included in the final treaty signed by the Americans, Europeans and Russians.</p><p>“The bottom line is, that’s a ridiculous argument,” Mr. Baker said in an interview in 2014, a few months after Russia seized Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine. “It is true that in the initial stages of negotiations I said ‘what if’ and then Gorbachev himself supported a solution that extended the border that included the German Democratic Republic,” or East Germany, within NATO. Since the Russians signed that treaty, he asked, how can they rely “on something I said a month or so before? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>In fact, while Mr. Putin accuses the United States of breaking an agreement it never made, Russia has violated an agreement it actually did make with regard to Ukraine. In 1994, after the Soviet Union broke apart, Russia signed an accord along with the United States and Britain called the Budapest Memorandum, in which the newly independent Ukraine gave up 1,900 nuclear warheads in exchange for a commitment from Moscow “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” and “to refrain from the threat or use of force” against the country.</p><p>Russia trampled Ukrainian sovereignty when it annexed Crimea and sponsored proxy forces to wage war against the Kyiv government in eastern Ukraine. And it is once again threatening the use of force by assembling 100,000 Russian troops along its border to extract guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO.</p><p>The dispute traces back to the final years of the Cold War, when East and West were negotiating the framework of what Mr. Bush would call the new world order. The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, led to negotiations over unifying the two Germanys formed after World War II.</p><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Mr. Baker served as President George H.W.

On Jan. 31, 1990, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said in a speech that there would not be “an expansion of NATO territory to the east, in other words, closer to the borders of the Soviet Union.”</p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.7068181818181816\" morss_score=\"25.665751515151516\"><p>He was talking about whether NATO troops would be stationed in territory then constituting East Germany, not whether other countries would eventually be considered for membership in the alliance.

The word “jurisdiction” could imply that the NATO doctrine of collective defense would apply only to part of German territory, limiting German sovereignty. It was one thing to agree not to move troops into the East right away, as far as American officials were concerned, but all of Germany had to be part of NATO.</p><p>“The N.S.C. got to him pretty quickly and said that language might be misinterpreted,” Condoleezza Rice, then a Soviet adviser to Mr. Bush and later secretary of state under President George W.

In the agency’s more than a century of policing, no officer has ever been prosecuted for fatally shooting someone, according to a spokesman. That history aligns with a longstanding pattern across the country of little accountability for police officers’ use of deadly force.</p><p>Prosecutors and a grand jury concluded that Trooper Splain’s first three lethal shootings were justified, and an inquiry into the most recent one is ongoing. Rather than have independent outsiders look into the killings, the police agency has conducted its own investigations — which were led by officers from his unit — raising questions about the rigor of the inquiries.</p><p>“When a police officer has shot at and potentially killed a civilian, the public will never trust the police agency to investigate itself and be unbiased,” said Tom Hogan, the former district attorney of Chester County, Pa.

The trooper shot two unarmed drivers because they were<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/us/police-traffic-stops-killings.html\" title=\"\">Times found in an earlier investigation</a> that uncovered hundreds of seemingly avoidable killings by the police — often with impunity.

The other troopers who were involved in the shootings or who led the investigations declined to comment or did not respond to messages. David Kennedy, the president of the state troopers’ union, responded on Trooper Splain’s behalf to written questions, saying he had acted with courage and “was forced to make split-second decisions no one hopes they ever have to make.”</p><p>Cpl. Brent Miller, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, said, “We are confident we have the resources to investigate such incidents thoroughly and objectively.” He</p><p>All troopers involved in shootings must attend specialized training to assess their physical and mental fitness before returning to active duty, he said, adding that in some cases, troopers may also be required to undergo use-of-force training at the police academy.</p><p>Darrel W. Stephens, a former longtime police chief who now helps run a policing research institute at Florida State University, called the four shootings a “red flag.”</p><p>“Four is incredibly unusual,” he said. “That is out there on the edge.” Even if the shootings can be legally justified, he said, the pattern needs to be “examined very closely” to determine why the same officer repeatedly resorted to deadly force. “Because they can, it doesn’t mean they should,” he said.</p><p>It’s not clear how common it is for police officers to fatally shoot multiple people during their careers.

Nicholas Shallcross, said that his ambitions had shifted during college from the military to law enforcement.</p><p>Trooper Splain, the lieutenant colonel said, saw himself as “a protector.”</p><h2>A Call For Help</h2><p>In July 2007, Joseph Rotkewicz, 37, who had bipolar disorder, took two of his brother’s guns into a room of his family’s home and repeatedly threatened to kill himself, pointing a gun at his head. His father had recently died, and his girlfriend had had an affair with his best friend.</p><p>For an hour, his sister, Linda Hunsicker, and a friend, Hans Frendt, tried to talk him down, Ms. Hunsicker recalled in an interview. Then Mr. Rotkewicz fired at least two shots at the ceiling.

Police tried once to call the house, but Ms. Hunsicker had brought the cordless phone out with her.</p><p>With a person threatening to harm only himself, “the overarching principle is, slow things down and don’t force a confrontation,” said Ashley Heiberger, a consultant to police departments and a former captain in Bethlehem, Pa.</p><p>Entering a house to challenge someone threatening suicide “is not consistent with generally accepted law enforcement practices,” he added, “and good officers and good agencies have been emphasizing these concepts and principles for decades.”</p><p>Current Pennsylvania State Police <a href=\"https://www.psp.pa.gov/contact/Pages/RTKL-REGULATIONS-AND-OPERATIONS-MANUALS.aspx?Paged=TRUE&amp;p_SortBehavior=0&amp;p_FileLeafRef=AR%207%2d12%2epdf&amp;p_ID=26&amp;PageFirstRow=61&amp;&amp;View=%7BC9B28FFF-B4E7-4572-9ED3-F9A910D7A492%7D\" title=\"\">regulations</a> call for troopers dealing with someone who is mentally ill to “take steps to calm/de-escalate the situation, when feasible,” and to “assume a quiet, nonthreatening manner.”</p><p>Ms. Hunsicker said no one had used a bullhorn or tried other ways to resolve her brother’s crisis peacefully. Instead, Trooper Splain and another trooper eventually entered the house.

Addicted to drugs for years, the 47-year-old was reeling after a breakup and being evicted by his mother, Jean Monaghan. After she called 911 seeking help for him, Trooper Splain and a junior trooper, Eddie Pagan, came to her family farm and persuaded her to lure him back.</p><p>Mr. Ardo pulled up but then appeared to reverse his Buick Reatta, according to the officers’ accounts. Rather than let him go, the troopers ran out the back door and got in their two patrol cars, hidden from view.

She added, “They were in no way in harm’s way if they would have just backed up and left him alone.<em>”</em></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/us/police-killings-traffic-stops-takeaways.html\" title=\"\">review by The Times of hundreds of killings</a> of unarmed motorists by police found that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/police-mentally-ill-deaths/2020/10/17/8dd5bcf6-0245-11eb-b7ed-141dd88560ea_story.html\" title=\"\">mental health crises</a> were a recurring theme.

Some police departments now call in district attorneys from neighboring counties, others have independent units to investigate fatalities.

Ms. Thome led the police on a “lengthy high-speed chase,” Ms. Graf, the district attorney, said later, with “no regard for traffic lights, signs, police sirens, other vehicles on the roadway or the safety of the general public.”</p><p>Many police departments ban high-speed pursuits of nonviolent offenders, especially if officers know who they are and can find them later. Instead, records show, Trooper Splain performed a risky maneuver to force Ms. Thome to stop.</p><p>The Accord spun out into a field. Ms. Thome then drove into Officer Haase’s S.U.V. The two troopers jumped out of their vehicle, guns drawn. “Stop, stop, get out of the car, show me your hands,” Trooper Splain recalled shouting, according to a police interview quoted in a lawsuit filed by Ms. Thome’s family.</p><p>He fired first, followed by the rookie. Ms. Thome, hit seven times, died almost instantly, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>In an April 2020 press release describing the killing, Ms. Graf, the prosecutor, said Ms. Thome “accelerated forward and drove into” the officer’s vehicle. The release also described Troopers Splain and Haber as saying they feared multiple outcomes, including Ms. Thome reversing and running over officers or continuing “to ram” the S.U.V.</p><p>But Officer Haase estimated her speed to be five miles an hour, adding that he was more worried about damage to his vehicle than about his safety, according to his interviews with police included in the lawsuit. Neither vehicle’s airbags deployed, the lawsuit said; a photograph showed that the S.U.V. sustained minimal damage.</p><p>No police commands could be heard in a dash-camera video. Trooper Splain told police 30 seconds had elapsed between his leaving the car and shooting. The video, included in the lawsuit, shows it took only a few seconds.</p><p>“Their job was to talk her out of the vehicle and into safety,” said Thomas Kline, a lawyer for Ms. Thome’s family. “And instead, they did just the opposite, which was to fire multiple rounds of bullets into her pinned-down vehicle, leaving her defenseless and tragically dead.”</p><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Excerpted from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/29/us/charity-thome-complaint.html\" title=\"\">a lawsuit</a> over the death of Ms. Thome.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Agency <a href=\"https://www.psp.pa.gov/contact/RTKL%20DOCUMENTS/FR%209-1.pdf\" title=\"\">policy</a> says Pennsylvania state troopers should not shoot at moving vehicles unless the driver “poses an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury,” or if shooting is the last resort to prevent a suspect in a violent felony from escaping.</p><p>In the release, Ms. Graf said she had assigned her detective bureau to</p><p>Ms. Graf had <a href=\"https://lebtown.com/2020/04/27/da-discusses-details-process-that-led-to-justified-shooting-finding-in-thome-death/\" title=\"\">determined that the shooting was justified</a> after about a month — a relatively fast conclusion compared to similar inquiries reviewed by reporters.

Until now, his full record of killings has not been disclosed; the Pennsylvania State Police even <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/midstate/2014/04/police_shootings.html\" title=\"\">successfully fought</a> a lawsuit seeking to identify him and provide other details in one shooting. In the agency’s more than a century of policing, no officer has ever been prosecuted for fatally shooting someone, according to a spokesman. That history aligns with a longstanding pattern across the country of little accountability for police officers’ use of deadly force.</p><p>Prosecutors and a grand jury concluded that Trooper Splain’s first three lethal shootings were justified, and an inquiry into the most recent one is ongoing. Rather than have independent outsiders look into the killings, the police agency has conducted its own investigations — which were led by officers from his unit — raising questions about the rigor of the inquiries.</p><p>“When a police officer has shot at and potentially killed a civilian, the public will never trust the police agency to investigate itself and be unbiased,” said Tom Hogan, the former district attorney of Chester County, Pa. A Republican, he <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/district-attorney-guidelines-police-shooting-hogan/2040000/\" title=\"\">helped write</a> recommendations by the state prosecutors’ association for independent investigations — a reform that many departments resist, but one sought by the national prosecutors’ association and major policing groups.</p><p>In its review of Trooper Splain’s killings, The New York Times found inconsistencies between the evidence of what occurred and what the state police said had happened. The officer appeared to have departed from police protocols in several of the fatal confrontations, according to interviews and an examination of investigative and court records.</p><p>In three of the encounters, the people killed were in vehicles. The trooper shot two unarmed drivers because they were<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/us/police-traffic-stops-killings.html\" title=\"\">Times found in an earlier investigation</a> that uncovered hundreds of seemingly avoidable killings by the police — often with impunity. Many large police departments <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/us/police-traffic-stops-shooting.html\" title=\"\">ban shooting</a> at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/30/video/police-traffic-stops-danger-video.html\" title=\"\">moving vehicles</a> because it is very often dangerous, ineffective and unnecessary.</p><p>Trooper Splain, who is on desk duty until the pending inquiry is completed, did not return calls or reply to a letter seeking comment. The other troopers who were involved in the shootings or who led the investigations declined to comment or did not respond to messages. David Kennedy, the president of the state troopers’ union, responded on Trooper Splain’s behalf to written questions, saying he had acted with courage and “was forced to make split-second decisions no one hopes they ever have to make.”</p><p>Cpl. Brent Miller, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, said, “We are confident we have the resources to investigate such incidents thoroughly and objectively.” He</p><p>All troopers involved in shootings must attend specialized training to assess their physical and mental fitness before returning to active duty, he said, adding that in some cases, troopers may also be required to undergo use-of-force training at the police academy.</p><p>Darrel W. Stephens, a former longtime police chief who now helps run a policing research institute at Florida State University, called the four shootings a “red flag.”</p><p>“Four is incredibly unusual,” he said. “That is out there on the edge.” Even if the shootings can be legally justified, he said, the pattern needs to be “examined very closely” to determine why the same officer repeatedly resorted to deadly force. “Because they can, it doesn’t mean they should,” he said.</p><p>It’s not clear how common it is for police officers to fatally shoot multiple people during their careers.

Addicted to drugs for years, the 47-year-old was reeling after a breakup and being evicted by his mother, Jean Monaghan.

Ms. Thome led the police on a “lengthy high-speed chase,” Ms. Graf, the district attorney, said later, with “no regard for traffic lights, signs, police sirens, other vehicles on the roadway or the safety of the general public.”</p><p>Many police departments ban high-speed pursuits of nonviolent offenders, especially if officers know who they are and can find them later. Instead, records show, Trooper Splain performed a risky maneuver to force Ms. Thome to stop.</p><p>The Accord spun out into a field. Ms. Thome then drove into Officer Haase’s S.U.V. The two troopers jumped out of their vehicle, guns drawn. “Stop, stop, get out of the car, show me your hands,” Trooper Splain recalled shouting, according to a police interview quoted in a lawsuit filed by Ms. Thome’s family.</p><p>He fired first, followed by the rookie. Ms. Thome, hit seven times, died almost instantly, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>In an April 2020 press release describing the killing, Ms. Graf, the prosecutor, said Ms. Thome “accelerated forward and drove into” the officer’s vehicle. The release also described Troopers Splain and Haber as saying they feared multiple outcomes, including Ms. Thome reversing and running over officers or continuing “to ram” the S.U.V.</p><p>But Officer Haase estimated her speed to be five miles an hour, adding that he was more worried about damage to his vehicle than about his safety, according to his interviews with police included in the lawsuit. Neither vehicle’s airbags deployed, the lawsuit said; a photograph showed that the S.U.V. sustained minimal damage.</p><p>No police commands could be heard in a dash-camera video. Trooper Splain told police 30 seconds had elapsed between his leaving the car and shooting. The video, included in the lawsuit, shows it took only a few seconds.</p><p>“Their job was to talk her out of the vehicle and into safety,” said Thomas Kline, a lawyer for Ms. Thome’s family. “And instead, they did just the opposite, which was to fire multiple rounds of bullets into her pinned-down vehicle, leaving her defenseless and tragically dead.”</p><figure><span>Image</span><figcaption><span>Excerpted from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/29/us/charity-thome-complaint.html\" title=\"\">a lawsuit</a> over the death of Ms. Thome.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Agency <a href=\"https://www.psp.pa.gov/contact/RTKL%20DOCUMENTS/FR%209-1.pdf\" title=\"\">policy</a> says Pennsylvania state troopers should not shoot at moving vehicles unless the driver “poses an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury,” or if shooting is the last resort to prevent a suspect in a violent felony from escaping.</p><p>In the release, Ms. Graf said she had assigned her detective bureau to</p><p>Ms. Graf had <a href=\"https://lebtown.com/2020/04/27/da-discusses-details-process-that-led-to-justified-shooting-finding-in-thome-death/\" title=\"\">determined that the shooting was justified</a> after about a month — a relatively fast conclusion compared to similar inquiries reviewed by reporters.
