            <p>
             President Trump predicted “bedlam” and a lack of clarity about the presidential results until weeks after Election Day as he barnstormed Pennsylvania, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made his first joint appearance with former President Barack Obama at an event in Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last Saturday before Election Day offered traditional last-minute frantic campaigning in battleground states played against the backdrop of the extraordinary rancor, high stakes and sense of disruption reflecting a pandemic, an economic downturn and recurring protests and unrest at the close of Mr. Trump’s first term.
            </p>
            <p>
             In remarks in Newtown, Pa., and Reading, Pa., Mr. Trump stoked fears of an election left unsettled after voting closes on Nov. 3 and about the prospects that ballots would not count.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You’re going to be waiting for weeks” as votes are counted, Mr. Trump declared in Newtown.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Many, many days,” he went on. “So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision, because Pennsylvania’s very big. We’re going to be waiting. Nov. 3 is going to come and go, and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country.”
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             At his next stop, in Reading, Mr. Trump derided a Supreme Court decision rejecting a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to decide whether the state could continue accepting ballots for three days after Nov. 3.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You see what’s going on, right?” Mr. Trump said of Democrats. “Somebody’s going to play games, and they just got an extension. What’s the extension all about? Wouldn’t you like to hear, Nov. 3, we win, we lose? We win, we lose. Whatever.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The president called the decision “disappointing” and added, “Many, many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. They talk about we control the Supreme — well we don’t control the Supreme Court. That was a terrible decision.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The question of how long ballots can be accepted in battleground states has been a dominant one as Nov. 3 approaches. So has the question of whether Mr. Trump will try to declare victory if he is leading in specific states on Election Day, regardless of whether they have been called in his favor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump barely addressed the coronavirus pandemic at his first two stops, other than to praise his administration, complain about Mr. Biden’s focus on the pandemic and to falsely claim once again that the country was “rounding the turn” as the number of daily new cases nationally has spiked to almost 100,000.
            </p>

            <p>
             Mr. Obama, appearing with Mr. Biden in Flint, Mich., at their first stop of the day, mocked Mr. Trump as heartless.
            </p>

            <p>
             Noting Mr. Trump’s baseless claim a day earlier that doctors were profiting from coronavirus deaths, Mr. Obama said, “He cannot fathom — he does not understand — the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump is continuing to hold crowded rallies as the pandemic rages, and Mr. Obama ridiculed him for his fixation on crowd sizes, asking: “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden spoke next, praising Mr. Obama and ripping Mr. Trump over the pandemic as well. He too invoked Mr. Trump’s baseless statement made at a rally on Friday about doctors and coronavirus-related fatalities.
            </p>
            <p>
             “What in the hell is wrong with this man?” Mr. Biden asked. “Excuse my language, but think about it. It’s perverted. He may believe it because he doesn’t do anything other than for money.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Where both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden campaigned on Saturday was as revealing as what both men said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two states were part of the so-called Blue Wall — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which have leaned Democratic in recent national elections but which were crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 over Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has struggled in all three states throughout the 2020 campaign and is pressing to keep at least one of the three as part of his map this year, in an election cycle marked by a coronavirus pandemic and an economic recession. Pennsylvania is seen by Mr. Trump’s advisers as the likeliest state among the three for him to win.
            </p>

             In Newtown in Bucks County, Mr. Trump delivered a subdued speech, speaking from the teleprompter at first, to several hundred people seated in folding chairs arrayed in a field in front of a stage and a podium.

            <p>
             The speech took place in a field in front of the farmhouse where George Washington planned the crossing of the Delaware River. The small crowd sat close together, mostly unmasked. Unlike it has done at his other rallies, Mr. Trump’s campaign did not position energetic supporters in a stand behind him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president criticized Mr. Biden’s record on trade in a state hit hard in recent years by job losses and after the economic downturn this year caused by the coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump’s teleprompter appeared to have problems at one point, but for the first 45 minutes of his appearance, the president tried to stick to a speech that appeared designed to present him in a more “presidential” light, avoiding some of the angry and defensive outbursts that have been central to his rallies.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then he appeared to lose interest in the speech and began to riff about Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, about his own news coverage and how unfair he thinks the coverage has been of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             He mocked Mr. Biden for wearing sunglasses and dismissed his Democratic rival as merely a puppet of liberal Democrats in Congress.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             And he went on a long, improvised riff about his administration’s production of ventilators as he downplayed concerns about the coronavirus even as the country neared 100,000 new cases a day, with hospitalizations spiking.

             “We have done an incredible job. At some point they are going to recognize that,” Mr. Trump said after mocking Mr. Biden for focusing too much on the virus. “We’ve done an A-plus job. I give ourselves a D, or maybe an F, in terms of public relations.”
            </p>
            <p>
             On Saturday, he said of Mr. Biden’s concerns about the pandemic, “We agree, we agree it’s serious,” but added that his rival’s “only plan is to make you a prisoner in your home, a prisoner in your own country.”.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Reading, Mr. Trump seemed buoyed by a bigger crowd than at his previous stop, as he talked about his own bout of the coronavirus and the fact that the first lady had caught it as well. Joking, he said, “At least those rumors that we don’t live together turned out to be false.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, for the second straight day, Mr. Biden traveled to the Upper Midwest, a critical region where he has multiple ambitions: to win back voters who drifted to Mr. Trump in 2016 and to turn out as many traditional Democratic voters, including Black residents, as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             After making stops in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin on Friday, Mr. Biden devoted Saturday to Michigan. He enlisted a marquee surrogate to help his cause: Mr. Obama, whose presence the campaign hoped would excite voters and help drive turnout in the campaign’s final days.
             
             
            </p>
            <p>
             In the past two weeks, Mr. Obama campaigned solo for Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania and Florida, but Saturday was the first time in the general election that he and Mr. Biden had campaigned together in person. The former president has the potential to help Mr. Biden, who served two terms as his vice president, with key groups like Black voters as well as younger people who might not be naturally drawn to a septuagenarian moderate like Mr. Biden.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           
            <p>
             At a drive-in car rally in Flint, Mr. Obama laid into Mr. Trump over his handling of the pandemic, emphasizing a theme that has been a central message for Mr. Biden in the closing days of the campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, in Detroit, hundreds of people waited in cars to see Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden on Belle Isle, a state park on an island in the middle of the Detroit River with expansive views of the skylines of Detroit and of Windsor, Ontario.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The last four years have been hell,” said Miriam Pizana of Detroit, who came to the rally with her daughter Kristen. “We never knew what the chief of staff or communications directors’ names were before, and now we know them all, and not for anything good.”

                     “Here we are, the worst week, this week! I mean, we’ve been going through this now for months. The federal government has had an opportunity to respond — for months. And his closing argument, this week is that the press and people are too focused on Covid! ‘Covid, Covid, Covid,’ he’s complaining. He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage. And now he’s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic. Think about that. He said this just yesterday. Said doctors are overblowing it because they’re going to make money off it — doctors! He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck. There was just a study by Stanford University that just came out showing thousands of people are likely to have gotten sick because of these rallies he’s holding. What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that? He’s always worried — this is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worrying about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugs him. He talked about, he’s still talking about that. Does he have nothing better to worry about? Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized? What’s with crowds? Well you know, I’ve had crowds before, you know, had quite a few. But, you know, when a country is going through a pandemic, that’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about!”

          FLINT, Mich. — Former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tag-teamed President Trump in their first joint appearance of 2020, with the former president joking that Mr. Trump was “traumatized” by low turnout at his childhood birthday parties and Mr. Biden suggesting he would have bopped Mr. Trump in their younger days.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the final weekend of the campaign, Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama began Saturday with a drive-in rally in Flint in a bid to maximize turnout. Later, they held another drive-in rally in Detroit, where Stevie Wonder performed. The Biden campaign also announced that Mr. Obama would campaign in Atlanta and South Florida on Monday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Obama won Michigan twice, and Genesee County, home to Flint, is an example of a place where Democrats lost significant ground in 2016 compared with how the Obama-Biden ticket had fared.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Flint, the former president began by praising Mr. Biden for his decency, then pivoted to offense, the task
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/us/politics/obama-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           he has pursued with vigor
          </a>
          in appearances over the past two weeks. He laced into his successor for

           suggesting on Friday
          </a>
          that physicians are magnifying the severity of the pandemic to make money.
         </p>
         <p>
          “He cannot fathom — he does not understand — the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck,” Mr. Obama said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The former president also took aim at Mr. Trump’s fixation on the size of the crowds that turn out for him. “What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size?” he asked. “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?”
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Trump for his reported comments about America’s war dead and noted that Mr. Trump “likes to portray himself as a tough guy.” Then he suggested he would have wanted to punch Mr. Trump back in the day. “When you were in high school, wouldn’t you have liked to take the shot?” Mr. Biden said. “Anyway, that’s a different story, but anyway. A macho man.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Later, in Detroit, Mr. Biden mocked Mr. Trump for having written off as business expenses
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/business/trump-taxes-hair.html\" title=\"\">
           more than $70,000 paid to style his hair
          </a>
          during “The Apprentice.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I tell you what, man,” Mr. Biden said. “I hardly have any hair, but I’d rather have what I have.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Their visit to Michigan also included a clutch shot by Mr. Obama, who drained a 3-pointer in a school gym in Flint and then walked off the court. “That’s what I do,” he said.

                     “And I think we will win Minnesota. We’re very close last time. And we should win it, when they let Minneapolis burn, we should win it. But I think we’re going to win it. And again, 1972 was the last time. Can you believe that? I think we’re going to do it. We’ll find out. You’re going to know it about — Well I hope, based on the Supreme Court, they don’t delay it too long, this decision yesterday, I will tell you was not a good decision. You’re allowed to wait days to count and days to have the final count. You’re allowed to have time limits beyond Nov. 3. So what does this mean? The whole world, and our nation, is going to be waiting and waiting and waiting to hear who won. They’re going to — You’re going to be waiting. You’re going to be waiting for weeks and a very dangerous thing happens Nov. 3 and now you have to wait and wait. And very bad things can happen with ballots during that period of Nov. 3 to whatever date they gave them. Many many days. So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania is very big. And as you know, there was another state. But perhaps other states as well. This is a terrible thing that they’ve done to our country. And that’s the United States Supreme Court I’m talking about. That is a terrible, political, horrible, decision that they made. We’re going to be waiting Nov. 3 is going to come and go. And we’re not going to know and you’re going to have bedlam in our country.” ”This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country. And I say it, and I say it loud, and I say it proud.” “Just three days from now and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you’re there. And sure as we’re here together that wave is forming and they see it. They see it on all sides and there’s not a thing they can do about it.”

          President Trump predicted on Saturday that the presidential election would not be decided on Tuesday, warning that “you’re going to be waiting for weeks” and suggesting — with no evidence — that “very bad things” could happen while states are counting ballots in the days after Election Day.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s comments came as he kicked off four Saturday campaign stops in Pennsylvania with a subdued speech to several hundred people, boasting about his accomplishments and attacking his rival while he predicted victory next week.
         </p>
         <p>
          “So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania’s very big,” Mr. Trump said at his first stop in Newtown. “We’re going to be waiting, Nov. 3 is going to come and go, and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s campaign has aggressively sought to prevent Pennsylvania and other states from extending the time they are allowed to count mail-in ballots, which have been used in greater numbers than ever before because of concerns about in-person voting during the pandemic. On Friday, the
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/supreme-court-pennsylvania-north-carolina-absentee-ballots.html\" title=\"\">
           Supreme Court ruled that Pennsylvania officials can accept absentee ballots for three days
          </a>
          after Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And I say it, and I say it loud and I say it proud.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Despite his concerns about ballots, Mr. Trump predicted that Republicans would win the presidency and do well in congressional elections, waving aside polls which suggest that Democrats are leading in battleground states across the country.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s first speech took place in a field in front of the farmhouse where George Washington planned the crossing of the Delaware River. The small crowd sat close together, mostly unmasked. Mr. Trump did not have his typical backdrop of energetic supporters standing behind him.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was more animated in his second rally of the day, in Reading, where he spoke before a boisterous crowd of several thousand supporters. The president called his rivals names, lashed out at the news media, made false assertions about his record and suggested again that the election would not be decided on Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          He played video clips on a large screen showing his rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., making verbal gaffes, with Sean Hannity, a Fox News host, calling him a “clear and present danger to this country.” The president also played a Halloween-themed television ad on the screen showing an adult trick-or-treater approaching a home wearing a Biden mask.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Know who you’re voting for. Don’t get tricked,” the person said, taking off the mask to reveal the face of Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Trump has two more rallies in Pennsylvania as he races to try to catch up to Mr. Biden, his Democratic rival, who has consistently led in polls in the crucial swing state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Newtown, Mr. Trump’s teleprompter appeared to have problems at one point, but for the most part he tried to stick to a speech that appeared designed to present him in a more “presidential” light, avoiding some of the angry and defensive rants that have been central to his rallies.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Reading, Mr. Trump seemed impressed by the size of his crowd, suggesting that the passion among his supporters would save the day for his re-election campaign.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This doesn’t seem like someone who is going to come in second, do you?” Mr. Trump asked. “I don’t think so.”

          Police officers and sheriff’s deputies in Graham, N.C., deployed a chemical spray and arrested eight people at a march and rally on Saturday that were intended to honor George Floyd and encourage people to vote, according to the police and participants.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I am truly disturbed by the fact that people who are charged to protect and to serve” sprayed a chemical agent on marchers who were taking people to the polls, said the Rev. Gregory B. Drumwright, an organizer of
          <a href=\"https://www.thetimesnews.com/story/news/2020/10/14/activist-announces-i-am-change-march-wednesday-press-conference/3658546001/\" title=\"\">

          , who was among those arrested.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We never got to the polls because the sheriff’s office worked overtime to find a way to quell our efforts and suppress our voices,” he said in an interview.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Graham police said in a statement that officers had deployed a “pepper-based vapor” after the marchers blocked traffic in the street, “causing a traffic and safety hazard.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Eventually, the march moved on to a courthouse for a speaking program, where the police also intervened. Officers once again sprayed a “pepper-based vapor onto the ground to assist in dispersing the crowd,” the police said, adding that several people had ignored commands to leave.
         </p>
         <p>
          The people arrested were charged with offenses including failing to disperse and one count of assault on a law enforcement officer, the police said.

          Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is up for re-election on Tuesday,
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NC_Governor/status/1322697365636239361\" title=\"\">
           said on Twitter
          </a>
          that the confrontation was “unacceptable.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “Peaceful demonstrators should be able to have their voices heard and voter intimidation in any form cannot be tolerated,” Mr. Cooper wrote.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mayor Ian Baltutis of nearby Burlington, N.C., who marched and spoke at the event, said it had drawn a multiracial crowd of about 150 to 200 people in Graham, a city of about 15,000 located 50 miles northwest of Raleigh.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Baltutis said that after a sheriff’s deputy ordered the crowd to disperse within five minutes, deputies used the spray and tried to push people across the street.
         </p>
         <p>
          “As an elected leader, it’s not an example of the professional policing and de-escalation we would expect,” Mr. Baltutis said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Alamance County Sheriff’s Office, which also used the spray, according to participants, did not respond to requests for comment.

          AUSTIN, Texas — Multiple vehicles bearing Trump flags and signs surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus heading from San Antonio to Austin on Friday, forcing campaign officials to scrap two campaign events, according to
          
          
          reports by Democratic officials on Saturday.
         </p>
         <p>
          The vehicles surrounded the bus on busy Interstate 35 and appeared to be attempting to slow it down and force it to the side of the road, according to social media posts from witnesses and accounts by party activists. In one instance, the vehicles pulled in front of the bus and tried to stop in the middle of the highway.
         </p>
         <p>
          Katie Naranjo, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, tweeted that Trump supporters also “ran into a person’s car, yelling curse words and threats.” The bus was occupied by campaign staff workers, who notified local law enforcement, which assisted the vehicle in reaching its destination, party officials said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Out of “an abundance of caution,” they said, the campaign canceled an event scheduled for later that day at a parking lot belonging to the Texas A.F.L.-C.I.O. in downtown Austin. A campaign event in suburban Pflugerville was also scrapped.
         </p>
         
          
         <p>
          “Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way,” Tariq Thowfeek, the Texas communications director for the Biden for President campaign, said in a statement.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Our supporters will continue to organize their communities for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot,” Mr. Thowfeek said, “and to the Texans who disrupted our events: We’ll see you on November 3rd.

          More than 90 million votes have already been cast in the 2020 presidential election — about 65 percent of the total turnout in 2016, according to data updated Saturday afternoon by the
          <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html\" title=\"\">
           U.S. Elections Project
          </a>
          , an effort led by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number of early votes cast has already shattered the previous early turnout record set in 2016, thanks in large part to expansions of mail and absentee voting put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 91 million ballots have been sent to voters through the mail, and as of Saturday, 57 million of them have been returned. Over 32 million votes have been cast early and in person, according to the Elections Project.

           A New York Times analysis
          </a>
          of polling and ballot-request data shows that more Democrats have requested absentee ballots than Republicans have, and that most Republicans are likely to vote in person on Election Day. Experts have warned against drawing conclusions about the outcome of the race from early vote data for that reason and others. (Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s apparent edge in the early vote was
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/early-voting-registration.html\" title=\"\">
           widely reported
          </a>
          in 2016 in the days before she ultimately lost the Electoral College.)
         </p>
         <p>
          Still, experts have acknowledged that the early vote data so far does suggest turnout may exceed the 139 million votes cast in 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
          The early vote is being watched particularly closely in crucial swing states like Florida, a state the president narrowly carried against Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and where
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/politics/who-will-win-florida-polls.html\" title=\"\">
           polling is showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. slightly ahead

          . Data from the Elections Project shows that about 8.3 million ballots have been cast in Florida, a total representing roughly 59 percent of the registered voters in the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Texas, more than 9.6 million ballots had been cast as of Friday,

           more than the roughly 8.9 million Texans who voted statewide four years ago

          PITTSBURGH — In 2016, Allegheny County, which includes the city of Pittsburgh, voted for Hillary Clinton by a 16-point margin. At the same time, it gave Donald Trump more votes than he received in any other county in the state.
         </p>

          The battle over these margins is a matter of suburban geography, as a solidly blue city pushes further out against an ever-reddening western Pennsylvania, a shoving match that will go far in determining the winner of the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the front lines of that Democratic push is an army of “resistance” groups formed immediately after the 2016 election, mostly consisting of midcareer women who were electrified by Mr. Trump’s election. Marie Norman, 55, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, is one of them: Her group, called the Order of the Phoenix, has been churning out postcards and deploying door-to-door canvassers since forming nearly four years ago.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Saturday morning, Professor Norman was canvassing in the suburbs south of the city for statehouse candidates, including a state senator trying to hold a seat in hotly contested territory on the frontiers of the Democrats’ post-2016 suburban advance. “I feel a lot of energy this time canvassing — different from 2018,” she said. “I’m sure there’s more energy for Trump, too.”
         </p>
         <p>
          A few minutes later, an S.U.V. driving down the quiet street proved her point: It was covered with Trump decals and flying Trump flags.
         </p>
         <p>
          Along three suburban blocks, Professor Norman met Biden voters who were fervently hoping that he wins and others who were somewhat skeptical of him; a Trump voter who ripped up Professor Norman’s fliers at the door; and another who had a friendly discussion about not wanting to brainwash his children with his own political opinions. That she would be meeting all of these people while campaigning for a state house candidate would have been unthinkable before the 2016 election.
         </p>
         <p>
          Professor Norman said she felt confident in a Biden victory in the county in terms of votes already cast — the Democrats currently hold a nearly 4-1 advantage in returned mail-in and absentee ballots — but she worried about whether the ballots would all be counted. A Trump win will be hard to recover from, she said, but win or lose, she plans to keep the Order of the Phoenix going, with a future focus on judicial elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The 2016 election, she said, “totally changed my life.”

          MIAMI — The biggest pool of votes in Florida is in Miami-Dade County, where turnout has been lagging among Black and Hispanic voters, both key demographics for Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Senator Kamala Harris spent Saturday in South Florida, trying to shore up votes in the final weekend of early voting, which has traditionally been when Democrats here close the gap with Republicans.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Everybody needs to vote,” Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told reporters in Palm Beach County. “We’re here to say, ‘Listen, everything is at stake.’”
         </p>
         <p>
          Democrats have plenty of work to do: Black voters and Puerto Rican voters, who tend to lean Democratic, have been casting ballots at a lower rate than the rest of the electorate in Miami-Dade, according to an analysis by Hawkfish, a Democratic technology and data firm.
         </p>
         <p>
          About 50 percent of Black voters and 45 percent of Puerto Rican voters have voted, compared to 58 percent of other Hispanic voters, 61 percent of white voters and 62 percent of
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/us/miami-cuban-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           Cuban-American voters
          </a>
          , who tend to lean conservative.
         </p>
         <p>
          Miami-Dade has about 1.5 million registered voters. Hillary Clinton won the county by some 300,000 votes, a margin that Joseph R. Biden Jr. is not expected to match — and that was not enough to win Mrs. Clinton the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Voters of Cuban, Colombian, Nicaraguan and

          </a>
          descent have appeared particularly receptive to the Republican narrative that Mr. Biden, who has a long record as a centrist, and Ms. Harris are socialists. At her first event of the day in Miami, Ms. Harris flicked at that concern.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Joe and I are proud, patriotic Americans,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          But the message has stuck.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re not leftists, as Cubans,” said Gloria Davis, a 59-year-old Republican, after voting for President Trump on Saturday at the library in Westchester, a conservative stronghold that as of Friday had the most early votes cast in the county. “I see the leftists in the Democratic Party.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Republicans kept hammering away at the line outside the Coral Gables Library, another voting site. Under the blazing sun, Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and other local Republicans denounced Democrats as closet socialists.
         </p>
         <p>
          “In Washington, they vote just like
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html\" title=\"\">
           Bernie Sanders
          </a>
          ,” Mr. Rubio said in Spanish as salsa music blared in the background.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden’s troubles with Black voters came up on Friday in a phone call between the campaign and local Democratic members of Congress ahead of Ms. Harris’s visit. Representative Frederica Wilson of Miami Gardens, who is African-American, raised concerns about the campaign’s ground game, according to a person briefed on the call. Ms. Wilson appeared with Ms. Harris at an event on Saturday, and the Biden team has planned a slew of Souls to the Polls events targeting Black voters on Sunday.
         </p>
         <p>
          One encouraging sign for Democrats has been increased turnout in Broward County, the most Democratic in the state, where Caribbean-American voters have been enthusiastic about Ms. Harris, whose father is Jamaican.
         </p>
         <p>
          “When we talk about African-American and Caribbean voters in Florida, they want to know they have a president who understands the commonality between all of us,” Ms. Harris said. “They want a president who speaks to our higher purposes and our better angels, as opposed to speaking to hate and division.”

          ROSWELL, Ga. — On Saturday afternoon, Senator Kelly Loeffler held a rally in the northern Atlanta suburbs, an affluent area that used to be a Republican safe space until Donald Trump
          <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/trump-wins-georgia-but-turns-some-atlanta-suburbs-blue/8HY6eDcPhoxEK5TiUcPeXJ/\" title=\"\">
           lost it
          </a>
          in 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
          If some voters in these suburbs have determined that the Republican Party has gone too far to the right — or fear that Trumpism has twisted the party — Ms. Loeffler had not come to change those kinds of minds.
         </p>
         <p>
          Standing on the back of a pickup in the parking lot of a mid-rise office building, Ms. Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat 10 months ago by Gov. Brian Kemp, bragged about her support for the president. She warned of the rise of socialism, the “fake news” and “the deep state” (“It’s all real,” she said). She gave a warm-up speaking spot to Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican congressional candidate best known for her embrace of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Loeffler also indicated that she had no plans to move to the center. And that could serve as a preview of the tenor of the complicated special-election contest for her seat, one that could help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Nov. 3 ballot is a crowded one, and if no candidate gets a majority of votes, the race will go to a January runoff. Leading in

          , the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Ms. Loeffler has been mostly duking it out with a rival Republican, Representative Doug Collins.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two Republicans have been engaged in a virtual primary of sorts, throwing mud and striving to out-conservative each other. And while some Republicans thought Ms. Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, might take a moderate path to win over suburban women, she instead tacked hard right as a campaigner,
          <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/15/kelly-loeffler-marjorie-taylor-greene-endorsement-429635\" title=\"\">
           enthusiastically accepting
          </a>
          the endorsement of Ms. Greene.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Roswell, before an outdoor crowd of about 100 people, Ms. Loeffler issued an awkwardly phrased sentence or two whose message was nonetheless clear: This is who she is. And she is not changing.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve had people give me feedback and say, you know, maybe you’re, you know, maybe you’d do more, get in the middle, whatever,” she said. “I am who I am because of my values.”

         <p>
          PHILADELPHIA — Add Debra Messing and Kathy Najimy to the thousands of canvassers spread out across Philadelphia for the Biden campaign on Saturday.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two actors went knocking door to door with Sharif Street, a state senator, as the Biden campaign’s turnout operation kicked into high gear in this epicenter of Democratic support in the critical battleground state.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Everything is on Pennsylvania, this is it,” said Ms. Messing as she rallied a group of canvassers on the corner of North Carlisle Street and West Susquehanna Avenue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Throughout the city, the Biden campaign has been deploying volunteers to the doors of likely Democratic voters who either have not returned their absentee ballot or never requested one. Nearly two million registered Democrats requested absentee ballots, compared with fewer than 790,000 Republicans.
         </p>
         
          
         <p>
          The message on Saturday from the canvassers was to make sure voters know how to navigate either the absentee ballot drop-off process, or voting on Election Day, with the focus on making a “plan to vote.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’m going to vote, and vote for Biden,” said Kevin Robinson, 66. Ms. Messing let out a whoop and told Mr. Robinson, who was favoring his left knee, that if he was physically unable to stand in line, he could move ahead in the line. “I’ll need that,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Messing and Ms. Najimy, who have long been politically active, said that even after having volunteered in previous elections, this one felt different and more urgent.
         </p>
         <p>
          “There is a feeling of unrest that I’ve never experienced before,” Ms. Najimy said. “It’s like Donald Trump has taken a hammer to whatever unity we had and smashed it.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, having celebrity canvassers can help a door-knocking operation’s success. While most canvassers are lucky to see half of the doors they knock crack open, nearly every resident came out to see Ms. Messing and Ms. Najimy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Vendetta Sample, 56, saw the two women and ran down her stoop to greet them. “I voted, I voted early,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Did you vote for —” Ms. Messing started to ask before she was cut off.
         </p>
         <p>
          “You dang know I did,” Ms. Sample said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Biden campaign app also had a man named Sean on its list who lived at Ms. Sample’s address. Ms. Messing asked about Sean and if he voted.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Sean’s not here, he’s working,” said Ms. Sample. “I don’t know if he voted.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “You’re going to call Sean and you’re going to say we came to see him, and you’re going to say you promised us that you would kick his ass if he doesn’t vote.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Sample smiled, pantomiming a kick, when her young grandson, wearing a Spider-Man mask, poked his head out.
         </p>
         <p>
          “What you say about my daddy?” he asked. “Say that again and I’ll punch you in your face.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The entire canvassing team laughed.
         </p>
         <p>
          “That’s Philly,” one said.

          SUN CITY, Ariz. — Don’t believe the polls. Don’t believe the media. And definitely do not believe the Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was the message from Republican leaders to the party’s foot soldiers gathering Saturday in Sun City. The volunteers were getting ready to fan out in this retirement community in Maricopa County, where Donald Trump won in 2016 with 49 percent of the vote, to rally voters for Mr. Trump and Martha McSally, the Republican senator whom polls have consistently shown running behind her Democratic challenger.
         </p>
         <p>
          “You all know why this is the most consequential election in our life,” Ms. McSally told the crowd inside the local Republican headquarters, flanked by cardboard cutouts of Mr. Trump and former President Ronald Reagan. “They’re coming after our county. They’re coming after our state.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Still, Ms. McSally tried to strike a cheerful tone.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re on the verge of a great American comeback,” she said to a round of cheers.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was little need to convince the crowd, who appeared to be optimistic about the party’s chances.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve never seen energy like we’re seeing now,” said Patti Thompson, a 72-year-old party activist who wore a Women for Trump T-shirt emblazoned with an image of a stars-and-stripes stiletto. “People care about saving our country. You can’t let the liberals take — we cannot let them run our country.”

          MILWAUKEE — Mary Beth Mathes brought her ballot to a drop box outside a public library on Milwaukee’s South Side Saturday, but she was missing one thing: the witness signature required by Wisconsin state law.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Ms. Mathes, a flight attendant for United Airlines, went inside the library to find Carol Dohm, the supervisor for the city’s early voting site at the library.
         </p>
         <p>
          On top of the drop box, Ms. Dohm signed Ms. Mathes’s ballot, then Ms. Mathes signed it too. Then both women engaged in a brief celebration, shimmying, throwing their arms in the air and yelling “yeaaaaah!”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I was just so excited to vote,” said Ms. Mathes, 50, who voted for President Trump. “I’m going to be back in town on Election Day, but I didn’t want to deal with the long lines.”
         </p>
         <p>
          While Milwaukee is heavily Democratic, its South Side, filled with a mix of Hispanic and older white voters, is the most Republican part of the city.
         </p>
         <p>
          A slow procession of voters came to the Tippecanoe branch of the Milwaukee Public Library Saturday. Just five voters at a time were allowed inside the area within the library set aside for voting, where two machines were in use. Officials on site said the foot traffic had been much busier during the week, and the line had moved slowly last weekend, too.
         </p>
         <p>
          Milwaukee is one of just a few Wisconsin municipalities with in-person early voting this weekend. State law allows in-person early voting from Oct. 20 through Sunday, though most communities held their last early voting day on Friday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Voters who have received an absentee ballot but have yet to return it have until the polls close Tuesday night to either deposit the ballots in a drop box or hand deliver them to a municipal clerk or a polling place.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Mathes’s experience demonstrates one last hurdle to absentee voting that Wisconsin Republicans put in place when they enacted a series of electoral reforms in the last decade — finding a witness signature, which can be difficult for people who live alone during the pandemic, which is raging across Wisconsin.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Mathes said she voted for Mr. Trump because of his economic record and his stance opposing abortion rights. In a second term, she said, she hopes he would end many of the pandemic-related restrictions that have been put in place.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t know if we can resolve it,” she said of the virus. “Hopefully we can open things up again and keep people working.”

            Ohio could be decided by women in the hotly contested suburbs.

         <p>
          COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016, but multiple polls have painted a troubling new picture for Mr. Trump in a state that no Republican has ever won a presidential race without.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Ohio, as in much else of the nation, Mr. Trump has bled support from suburban voters. And so with Mr. Biden’s hold on Ohio’s metro centers, and Mr. Trump’s commanding lead in its rural areas, the tossup state could come down to voters like Amy W., a white college-educated Republican from Westerville, a suburb northeast of Columbus.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Saturday afternoon, she stood in line at her Franklin County polling station, located in a shopping center. The line ran through much of the parking lot but moved swiftly. Amy, 55, would only whisper that she planned to vote for Mr. Biden and declined to give her last name because she was afraid, she said, of Mr. Trump’s supporters.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was also why she was voting early: “When Trump said he was going to have people out watching, that scared the heck out of me,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amy, a payroll coordinator, said she was voting for Mr. Biden in honor of her mother, who died earlier this year in a nursing home after contracting the coronavirus. She blamed Mr. Trump for downplaying the threat of the virus.
         </p>
         <p>
          “She was alone, and I couldn’t be with her,” she said of her mother, and began crying softly. “I feel like I let her down.”

          In the final days of an historic campaign season, Democrats in Georgia are searching for people like Linda Wingfield.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Friday, Ms. Wingfield left her shift as a fast-food cook and cast a ballot for the very first time — at 59 years old.
         </p>
         <p>
          “It means a lot to me,” Ms. Wingfield said as she lined up along with about 15 other Black voters outside the Adams Park Library in Atlanta.
         </p>
         <p>
          After decades of staying away from the polls, Ms. Wingfield was spurred to vote by a strong dislike for President Trump.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We need somebody to help us, not destroy us,” she said, calling on “God’s faith” to elect Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
         </p>
         <p>
          Friday was the final day for early, in-person voting in Georgia. And as the numbers were posted on Saturday, some experts saw worrying signs in the numbers for Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of the nearly 2.7 million people who cast their ballots in early, in-person voting, only 709,000, or 26.4 percent, were identified as Black.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number does not include absentee ballots, and thousands of those have not been received.
         </p>
         <p>
          Even so, Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia in Athens, said the percentage of Black voters was in line with the numbers in the state during Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential race in 2016. “I believe Democrats would be concerned about the Black turnout where it is,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hoping to make sure the scales tip in their favor, Democrats are mounting a last-minute push, urging not only their loyal supporters to vote, but also reaching out to the apathetic and even chronic nonvoters, such as Ms. Wingfield.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t have to tell you the stakes,” Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate running against the incumbent, Senator David Perdue, said during in a Zoom call on Saturday with college students running a get-out-the-vote phone bank.
         </p>
         <p>
          He also announced that former President Barack Obama would be coming to Atlanta on Monday in an effort to “turn out voters and get everybody out to the polls on Election Day.”
         </p>
         <p>
          And on Saturday, Raphael G. Warnock, the pastor who is running against Senator Kelly Loeffler, was holding get-out-the-vote rallies with Democrats in DeKalb County and with South Asian voters in Suwanee, Ga.

          PHILADELPHIA — The corner of Limekiln Pike and East Pastorius Street was bustling with
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/1322574073608720386\" title=\"\">
           people bundled for a chilly day
          </a>
          of door-to-door canvassing here in northwest Philadelphia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Wearing masks with the word “vote” on them and clutching signs reading “African Americans for Biden,” they fanned out across this predominantly Black neighborhood, knocking on the doors of likely Democratic voters who had not yet returned their absentee ballots, or who hadn’t requested one at all.
         </p>
         <p>
          The city, which is the beating heart of Democratic support in this crucial battleground state, has been returning absentee ballots at a relatively high rate, with 74 percent returned as of Saturday, according to data from the U.S. Elections Project, an effort led by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          But Philadelphia, where 38 percent of registered voters requested absentee ballots, did not embrace the method as strongly as Allegheny County — home to Pittsburgh and
          
          
          the other major Democratic county in the state — where 44 percent of registered voters requested absentee ballots.
         </p>
         <p>
          Part of that is because the Democratic Party in Philadelphia
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/politics/democrats-in-person-voting.html\" title=\"\">
           began telling voters this month
          </a>
          that they should instead focus on in-person voting, and part of that is because the city has a strong Election Day voting tradition, which was evident on Saturday as canvassers knocked on numerous doors and were greeted with supportive fist pumps and pledges to vote early on Election Day.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ll be there,” said Edward Tomlin, 70, as he leaned out of his door to greet a Biden canvasser.
         </p>
         <p>
          His neighbors, members of the Griffin family, are all planning to vote in person on Election Day, including one person who will be voting for the first time.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Mr. Tomlin was told that there might be a line and he might want to bring a chair, he waved it off.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ll be fine,” he said.

          In the homestretch of the presidential election, the Biden campaign has dominated the paid media landscape.
         </p>
         <p>
          On television and radio, the Biden campaign spent $66.2 million over the past week — from Oct. 23 to Oct. 30 — while the Trump campaign spent only about $19.4 million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. The Republican National Committee has helped to pick up some of some of the Trump campaign’s slack and has run about $16 million worth of ads during the same period.
         </p>
         <p>
          The spending advantage for Democrats holds on Facebook, where the Biden campaign has spent roughly $9 million over the past week, and the Trump campaign has spent $4.4 million during the same stretch on the platform.
         </p>
         <p>
          The yawning spending gap between the two campaigns with just 72 hours to go until Election Day has persisted during the final weeks of the presidential race, as the Biden campaign has enjoyed an influx of donations at a time the Trump campaign has experienced a cash crunch.
         </p>
         <p>
          President Trump had at one point raised more than
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html\" title=\"\">

          for his re-election and had a fund-raising head start on Democrats. But

           that financial advantage has disappeared
          </a>
          , and Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered October with roughly triple the funds at his disposal as Mr. Trump: $177 million to $63.1 million. The Biden campaign has leveraged that cash advantage on the airwaves, going up with ads as Mr. Trump’s team has slashed its ad spending budget.

                    Trump’s Campaign Is Building an Army of Poll Watchers. What Can They Actually Do?

                    President Trump and his campaign have been calling for an army of poll watchers on Election Day. What is poll watching, and when does it cross the line? We look at how a federal consent decree restricted the Republican Party for decades, and why its expiration could make a difference in 2020.

                     This year, as the president has been talking about— “Fraud like you’ve never seen. They have these fake ballots. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll watchers.” “His language has taken on an almost militaristic tone.” “Go into the polls and watch very carefully. Be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.” There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections. Still, the president talks about recruiting an army of poll watchers. “It’s taken on such an aggressive nature in a way that we’ve kind of never seen before. It’s very frightening to election officials.” “It paints poll watching with a veneer of antagonism, combat and not in the spirit of protecting our elections.” But it’s more than just rhetoric. This year, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll watching operations in ways we haven’t seen for nearly 40 years. To understand why, let’s take a trip back in time — “Wherever I go, people ask me what a New Jersey vacation is like” — to a governor’s race in New Jersey in 1981. “When I ran in that election, it was a very interesting election, to say the least.” This was the Democratic candidate James Florio. And here he is now. “That’s a long time ago, that’s 40 years ago.” The race was an early referendum on the Reagan administration. “I like Tom Kean.” “Kean has endorsed Reaganomics and proposed cuts in state taxes on business. The Democratic candidate, Congressman James Florio, attacks both Reagan’s and Kean’s economic plan.” “We thought it would be an election on the merits of the issues” — “revitalizing our railroads, cleaning up toxic waste, strengthening law enforcement” — “turned out that was not all involving the merits.” It was the closest fought election in the history of the state. But as it turns out, it wasn’t a clean fight. “Election day yielded some surprises to a lot of people who went to the polls because people saw off duty policemen with armbands that said ‘members of the Ballot Security Task Force.’” “That’s the Republican group, which according to state Democrats, intimidated some minority voters.” “It looked very official. And they were standing there with their guns.” “They obstructed voters from casting ballots. But also they obstructed access by poll workers.” More than 200 task force members showed up at the polls, confronting voters in Democratic strongholds. They were in Newark but not in Short Hills. They were in Trenton but not Princeton. And Camden but not in Cherry Hill. “If you look at the demographics of the neighborhoods that were targeted for these efforts, they were all predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods. White voters were not targeted in the same way at all.” “So it was clear that they’re not concerned about ballot integrity. They’re concerned about intimidation. It was a very clever, sinister initiative.” In the end, Florio lost by a razor thin margin. “1,797 votes out of 2.3 million votes. The intimidation had an impact on the outcome of the election.” “It’s a case of sour grapes from Democrats that don’t know how to take defeat.” But this wasn’t just a local effort. Investigations suggested that the task force was organized and paid for by the Republican National Committee. “A covert operation that was at the very least intentionally misleading and resulted in technical violations of our election laws.” Democrats sued the R.N.C. for violating the Voting Rights Act. The R.N.C. was forced to enter into a federal consent decree that would restrict them for years to come. “For the better part of the past four decades, the Republican National Party has been under a consent decree that has limited their ability to coordinate some of these poll watching activities.” “So it created a mechanism that deterred any additional voter intimidation and also created a check on future R.N.C. efforts that might target minority communities.” Under the terms of the consent decree, the R.N.C. had to get court approval for poll watching plans. The party tried unsuccessfully to get out of it for many years. “And they were found to be in violation of the consent decree at least three times since it was put into place.” Then in 2017, the court allowed the consent decree to expire, setting up a different kind of fight in 2020. “This will be the first presidential election where we will see the Republican National Party operating a poll watching operation without the consent decree hovering over their heads. Now that it has been lifted, it looks like there is going to be a more organized and a bigger poll watching operation coming out of the Republican National Party.” Republicans say they’re training more than 50,000 poll watchers in at least 15 battleground states. They’ve released a series of carefully worded training presentations for volunteers. “Poll watchers are the first line of defense for President Trump. Be courteous to county staff and other watchers. Yes, even our Democrat friends. Do not speak with voters and do not interfere with the orderly conduct of the voting process.” Their presence at the polls is perfectly legal if they follow the rules. In early voting this year, there have been a few potential violations. Pennsylvania’s attorney general called out illegal surveillance of a ballot dropbox in Philadelphia. And local news in Florida reported on two armed private security guards who posted themselves near an early voting site. “Two armed security guards showed up outside of the downtown St. Pete early voting location.” “Pretty much ever since the president has been calling on his supporters to watch the polls, election officials and law enforcement agencies across the country have kind of been preparing for what may be an influx of people who don’t know the rules and regulations of poll watching.” In a statement, the R.N.C. said its poll watchers have received rigorous training to follow state laws and are not there to be intimidating. “The big unknown is exactly how big and how widespread the deployment of these poll watchers will be and whether they will have any kind of marching orders from the Republican Party or the Trump campaign to really question a bunch of voters’ eligibility or whether they’ll just kind of follow the more traditional ways.” Ultimately, the consent decree offered a legal shortcut to stop the R.N.C.’s poll watching operations if they crossed the line. “What’s important to keep in mind is that the tactics that were unlawful in 1980 are just as unlawful in 2020. There has never been permission for any political party or any private party to engage in racially targeted voter intimidation or voter intimidation of any sort. And so we’re not without protection. We’re not without tools to combat it. But we do have one less in our arsenal.” “If we see a resumption of the same type of thing this time, we’ll have to go back to court. I can be authoritatively the person that can be definitive and say that small margins make a big difference.”

          President Trump and his campaign have been calling for an army of poll watchers on Election Day. And with the expiration of a decades-old court order, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll-watching operations nationwide.
         </p>
         <p>
          The R.N.C. says its poll watchers are carefully trained, but the campaign’s rhetoric has raised fears of voter intimidation, like the kind that lead to the original court order. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee paid and organized armed, off-duty police officers to patrol polling stations in minority neighborhoods in New Jersey. Democrats sued, and got the R.N.C. to enter into a consent decree in 1982, restricting the party’s poll watching efforts for 35 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          It expired in 2017, making 2020 the first presidential election without this extra layer of protection. Voter intimidation remains illegal, but without the consent decree the main challenge is litigation, which could take years.

             The presidential race in Florida looks similar to 2016 in at least one regard: It’ll probably be close, maybe decided again by just
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\" title=\"\">
              a single percentage point
             </a>
             . But under the surface, there will be major differences in terms of who’s voting for whom.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump can count on the continued support of rural voters and white men, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. is almost guaranteed to carry strong support from women and African-American voters across the state.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Yet Mr. Biden is unlikely to hold on to Hillary Clinton’s strong showing with Latino voters. Instead, he’s looking to make up for it among some of the white voting blocs that Mr. Trump relied on in 2016, particularly suburbanites and older voters.
            </p>
            <p>
             A batch of high-quality Florida polls arrived this week — probably some of the last that we’ll see before the election — and they all showed Mr. Biden with an advantage of three to six percentage points among the state’s likely voters. Taken together, the surveys from
             <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_fl_102920.pdf/\" title=\"\">
              Monmouth University
             </a>
             ,
             <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/fl/fl10292020_crosstabs_bgth12.pdf\" title=\"\">
              Quinnipiac University
             </a>
             and
             <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NBC-News_Marist-Poll_FL-Likely-Voters_NOS-and-Tables_202010281159.pdf#page=3\" title=\"\">
              NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College
             </a>
             put Mr. Biden in a strong position to pull together a winning coalition in Florida, which has successfully predicted the victor in the past six presidential elections.
            </p>
            <p>
             In each poll, the difference was within the margin of error, and the polling miss of 2016 — when Florida surveys overestimated Mrs. Clinton’s support by a few points — should give us pause.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mr. Trump’s victory in Florida that year relied heavily on late-deciding voters, and in both the Monmouth and Marist polls, no more than 2 percent of voters said they still didn’t know how they would vote. Turnout is also on track to be considerably higher this year, which leaves less room for certain groups to under-participate, as Democratic voters did in 2016, further throwing off polls.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             The consistency of the findings from this week’s polls suggests that Mr. Trump does have ground to make up. The Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls also showed that he will be fighting the clock: In both surveys, just 17 percent of likely voters said they would vote on Election Day, with the rest planning to cast ballots early in person or by mail.

            <h2>
             The early returns
            </h2>
            <p>
             Turnout has been running high across the state, with more than seven million ballots already cast as of Thursday night. That’s nearly 80 percent of the total votes cast in 2016. After one more weekend of early voting and a few more days of mail ballots arriving, the vote tally could well surpass 2016’s total vote before Election Day even arrives.

            <p>
             Slightly more Democrats have turned out than Republicans, though only by 200,000 votes. That advantage is padded by Mr. Biden’s polling lead among independents, who have cast about one in five ballots so far.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the crosstabs from Monmouth University’s latest poll of Florida were to perfectly predict how Democrats, Republicans and independents are voting, then Mr. Biden would be winning 52 percent of early votes and Mr. Trump 43 percent, according to the
             <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/FL.html\" title=\"\">
              available voter data
             </a>
             on ballots already cast by Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Those are almost certainly not the exact real numbers, but they’re somewhere in that range.
            </p>
            <p>
             Republicans can count on a last-minute voting surge come Election Day, when they are almost certain to outnumber Democrats going to the polls. But given how many votes will have been cast by then, and since less than one in five voters are telling pollsters they plan to vote that day, it may be a steep uphill climb.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Older voters
            </h2>
            <p>
             Daniel Smith, a professor of political science and pollster at the University of Florida, has been tracking voter turnout by demographic groups, and he said he had been struck by the participation from older voters. Florida is home to vast numbers of retirees, and its diverse population of seniors is a heavily sought-after chunk of the electorate.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The senior vote has been huge so far,” Dr. Smith said, citing numbers showing that two-thirds of voters 65 and older had already voted. That is occurring in traditionally Republican areas — like Sumter County, home to the Villages, which has already matched its 2016 vote total — and more heavily Democratic ones, such as Broward County.
            </p>
           </div>

            <p>
             But the election may be won and lost in the middle, among the many older voters who cast ballots for Mr. Trump four years ago but have turned against him, and whose opposition has only been cemented by his response to the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Trump has doubled down on ‘Covid, Covid, Covid’ and the ‘hoax’ of this virus, and older voters aren’t buying it,” Dr. Smith said.

            <p>
             Yet Mr. Biden hasn’t left the president in the dust; according to the three polls this week, the candidates are roughly splitting older voters in Florida, meaning that Mr. Trump is hanging on to at least a slight majority of white seniors.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president has proved more consistently repellent to college-educated white voters across the state. These voters spurned Mrs. Clinton and supported him overwhelmingly in 2016, when he won 60 percent of white women with college degrees in Florida to Mrs. Clinton’s 37 percent, according to exit polls.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the Marist poll released on Thursday found that those numbers had more than flipped: Sixty-four percent of white, college-educated women in Florida supported Mr. Biden, and 35 percent backed Mr. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             The effect was particularly felt in the state’s suburbs, which Mr. Trump won handily in 2016 — and which largely stuck with Republicans in the 2018 midterm election, defying national trends. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll gave Mr. Biden a 14-point lead in suburban areas.
            </p>
            <h2>
             The diverse Latino population
            </h2>
            <p>
             Like most of the country, Florida tilted Democratic in 2018, with two House seats flipping blue. But in narrow races for senator and governor, Republicans eked out victories.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           <div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.84364820847\" morss_score=\"24.7821395044\">
            <p>
             Part of that was because of a drop in Democratic support among Latino voters. In 2016, 62 percent of Florida’s Latino voters broke for Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls; two years later, just 54 percent voted for the Democratic governor and Senate candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has worked to strengthen his support among Cuban-Americans in particular, and his claims that Democrats are flirting with socialism may carry a particular resonance with these voters, many of whom belong to families that fled the Castro regime. But it was not only among Cuban Latinos that Democrats’ margins suffered in 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the Democratic vote generally rose elsewhere, in the three Florida counties with
             <a href=\"https://www.floridatrend.com/article/15517/hispanic-diversity-in-florida-map\" title=\"\">
              the highest Hispanic populations
             </a>
             , it was down compared with two years earlier. One of those counties, Miami-Dade, has a high concentration of Cubans, but the others, Osceola and Hendry, are more heavily Puerto Rican and Mexican-American.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden was not the Latino community’s
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/us/politics/California-Bernie-Sanders.html\" title=\"\">
              first choice
             </a>
             in the Democratic primaries, and his lead over Mr. Trump among Latino voters has been unreliable since he became the nominee. That’s been particularly true in Florida, where some polls have shown him effectively tied with Mr. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’ve known for a while that Biden was unlikely to hit Clinton’s 2016 numbers, but the goal would be to do better than Nelson and Gillum did in 2018 and be more in line with where Obama was in 2012,” said Carlos Odio, a founder of EquisLabs, a liberal-leaning Latino research firm. That year, exit polls gave President Barack Obama a 21-point lead over Mitt Romney.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far, Mr. Biden has not managed that. Averaging together the results of the Monmouth, Marist and Quinnipiac polls this week, Mr. Biden led by just 12 points among Latinos.
            </p>
            <p>
             Latino voters now account for about one in five ballots cast in Florida, twice their share just 20 years ago.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           
            <p>
             Mr. Odio said that Democrats would seek to win over Cuban-American voters in Miami-Dade County, but that they would be largely focused on driving up turnout among the roughly seven in 10 Florida Latinos who are not Cuban.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Biden has a lot more room to grow, and these are populations where there are more late deciders,” Mr. Odio said. Latino voters are more likely than other groups to affiliate with neither party, and to be conflicted about which candidate to choose.
            </p>
            <p>
             But only a few days remain for that decision. And Florida this year intends to be efficient: While it is known for its vote-counting snafus, the state has a long history of accepting high numbers of mail-in ballots, and its election laws allow officials to begin counting them earlier than in many other states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Together with the fact that ballots must be received by Election Day in order to be counted, that means it’s possible the state could manage to declare a winner by the evening of Nov. 3, providing a powerful clue to which candidate is on track to win the presidency.
            </p>

            <p>
             On the weekend of Oct. 10, President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, his former adviser Stephen K. Bannon and a prominent new ally, a Chinese billionaire and Mar-a-Lago member named Guo Wengui, gathered at Mr. Guo’s luxury apartment overlooking Central Park for dinner and cigars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each faced some combination of legal or credibility issues, but on this night they had reason to celebrate: a plan was coming together.
            </p>
            <p>
             That weekend, Mr. Giuliani had delivered to The New York Post a copy of a hard drive purported to be from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, the son of Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The hard drive was filled with what the men claimed was compromising material about the younger Biden that they hoped would sully his father’s reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was the latest in an often-bumbling series of attacks that began two years ago with the goal of undercutting Mr. Biden as a threat to Mr. Trump’s re-election by linking him to the messy personal and business affairs of his son.

             The Post articles were quickly followed by others from Peter Schweizer, the conservative author who in 2016 had promoted unsubstantiated theories about corruption by the Clintons and who in this case was relying on material provided by a former associate of Hunter Biden who is

             While the president has promoted the material relentlessly, many of the Trump-friendly news outlets and other organizations that sustained the effort four years ago have been diminished or sidelined.

             While highlighting questions about the business activities of Hunter Biden and the former vice president’s brother James Biden, Mr. Giuliani and his allies have failed to prove that Joe Biden was involved in or a beneficiary of them.

            <p>
             As he seeks asylum, he has built bridges into Mr. Trump’s orbit. He is a member of Mr. Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Fla., Mar-a-Lago, and he is represented by a lawyer, Daniel T. Podhaskie, who had worked as an outside counsel for the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign.

            <p>
             When Mr. Bannon left the White House, Mr. Guo gave him a $150,000 loan, which Mr. Bannon later told The New York Times was related to a film project about the Chinese Communist Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon afterward, a media company associated with Mr. Guo, Guo Media,

              gave Mr. Bannon a $1 million contract
             </a>
             to introduce its executives to “media personalities” and advise it on industry standards, subjects on which Mr. Bannon had expertise as the former head of Breitbart News.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Guo’s representatives have said he is merely the face of Guo Media and not an owner, though its central property, G News, is closely identified with Mr. Guo and his cause. In April, an associated venture linked to Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon registered as a new business in New York, GTV Media, whose central hub is a Chinese-language, anti-Communist Party video platform.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a GTV video posted on Twitter in July, Mr. Guo described Mr. Bannon and Mr. Podhaskie as directors, noting their ties to Mr. Trump, though Mr. Bannon was removed from the board the next month after his arrest.

             The venture quickly raised $300 million, but as

             The media properties soon seized on a subject that represented a confluence of interest between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo — claims that Hunter Biden used his father’s name to make money from China.

               Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, was charged in August with defrauding donors to a pro-Trump initiative. He maintains his innocence. Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon began working together after Mr. Bannon left the White House in 2017.

             In September, the Guo-related media world started noting chatter about hard drives purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. In late September, the material was teased by the host of an anti-Beijing YouTube show who goes by Lu De. He is closely associated with Mr. Guo and appeared in a photograph with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bannon that was posted on G News and
             <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1304535784335249408\" title=\"\">
              later Twitter
             </a>
             shortly before he first brought up the material.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Weeks before the New York Post articles, Lu De, whose real name, according to GTV, is Wang Dinggang, claimed without evidence on his YouTube program that Chinese sources had sent “three hard disks” with damaging material about Chinese leaders and about Mr. Biden, including videos recorded by the Communist Party, to the Justice Department and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
            </p>
            <p>
             That broadcast
             <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy\" title=\"\">
              was first reported by The Daily Beast
             </a>
             , which also noted that three days later, a Twitter account associated with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo picked up that report. The tweet described “3 hard disk drives of videos and dossiers of Hunter Biden’s connections with the Chinese Communist Party” and said they had the makings of a “Big money and sex scandal!”
            </p>
            <p>
             Salacious material published on the Guo-linked sites is being picked up regularly by fringe outlets like Infowars and Gateway Pundit, providing it
             <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/inside-campaign-pizzagate-hunter-biden-n1244331\" title=\"\">
              a conduit to English-speaking audiences in the United States
             </a>
             . Those outlets, though, have faced hurdles on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms that have sought to block the explicit videos and suspend accounts circulating them.
            </p>
            <p>
             In recent days, GTV featured a notice saying it would continue to publish the videos but would “do our best” to filter graphic depictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bannon asserted that the effort to limit the spread of the New York Post’s articles on social media had backfired, drawing more attention to them. “Social media overplayed this and did us a favor,” Mr. Bannon said.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is unclear if the material featured on the sites linked to Mr. Guo is the same as that provided to The New York Post by Mr. Giuliani, which Mr. Giuliani said came from a laptop turned over to his lawyer by a computer store owner in Delaware.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Mr. Giuliani did not respond to questions about the origins of the materials featured by the Guo-linked outlets, nor did Mr. Guo’s lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             But in a statement, Mr. Guo said, “I support GTV’s efforts to make the public aware of the C.C.P.’s ability to infiltrate and gain influence in the U.S. government, the media and their families and friends through corruption, drugs and sex scandals.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He also said he had “not been involved in providing any information to The N.Y. Post regarding this story.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bannon said that Mr. Guo had not been connected to the acquisition of the hard drive that Mr. Bannon helped Mr. Giuliani provide to The New York Post.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mr. Bannon acknowledged that he pushes content to GTV, which also carries his podcast, War Room.

               The effort to use material about Hunter Biden to undercut his father’s campaign in the closing stages of the election extended beyond Mr. Giuliani to a loose network of conservatives.

             At the same time Mr. Bannon and Mr. Giuliani were shopping the purported hard drive, two other efforts were afoot to disseminate related information on Hunter Biden.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             In one, Mr. Schweizer had obtained a cache of emails from Bevan Cooney, the former Hunter Biden associate who is in prison for fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             Using those emails, Mr. Schweizer and a researcher for his watchdog group, the Government Accountability Institute, have published several stories, including one trying to draw a link between Hunter Biden’s dealings in China and his associates’ efforts to arrange meetings in Washington for Chinese business leaders during the Obama administration.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Schweizer’s institute, of which Mr. Bannon was a co-founder, has received funding from Ms. Mercer’s family, according to tax records. The Mercers have also provided funding to Breitbart News, which was
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/steve-bannon-breitbart-trump.html\" title=\"\">
              previously run by Mr. Bannon
             </a>
             and which has been publishing Mr. Schweizer’s articles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, Mr. Schweizer was consulted in September about the claims made by Mr. Bobulinski, who had worked in 2017 with Hunter and James Biden on a joint venture with a Chinese conglomerate that fizzled.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to two people familiar with the events, Mr. Bobulinski, an investor who had done business related to China, had approached allies of Mr. Trump, seeking assistance to publicize his claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bobulinski, who was admittedly bitter about the way the proposed deal unraveled, was referred to Mr. Passantino, who previously worked in the White House Counsel’s Office and works with a campaign-affiliated group, Lawyers for Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an effort to vet Mr. Bobulinski’s claims and documents, Mr. Passantino was referred by Mr. Gingrich, a longtime client, to Mr. Schweizer, who wrote a book in 2018 about business dealings involving Hunter Biden in Ukraine, China and elsewhere.

             Mr. Passantino “just asked advice,” Mr. Gingrich said. “And I said, ‘Look, the guy who knows the most about this is Schweizer,’ so I sent him Schweizer’s email address.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Passantino and Mr. Bobulinski met with Mr. Schweizer in September to review the materials, and Mr. Schweizer said they comported with his own research.
            </p>
            <p>
             Armed with that assurance, Mr. Passantino and Mr. Herschmann, who had worked first as a private lawyer for Mr. Trump, then as a member of the impeachment defense team and more recently as a West Wing official,
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/business/media/hunter-biden-wall-street-journal-trump.html\" title=\"\">
              attended a meeting in Virginia
             </a>
             to provide Mr. Bobulinski’s documents and outline his claims to a reporter from The Wall Street Journal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bobulinski has asserted that the former vice president was aware of, and stood to potentially profit from, the joint venture. Mr. Bobulinski says he met twice with the former vice president after he left office.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Journal

              dug into Mr. Bobulinski’s account
             </a>
             , and in the end reported that corporate records showed “no role for Joe Biden” in the deal and that the documents provided by Mr. Bobulinski “don’t show either Hunter Biden or James Biden discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, Mr. Gingrich, who posted a video this week highlighting some of the material, says it has resonated with Mr. Trump’s supporters, adding that if “you want to maximize your turnout, this is not a bad way to do it.”

             YIWU, China — Deep inside a 10-block-long factory outlet mall in China, the people who supply Americans with their plastic dinosaurs and “Kiss My Bass” baseball caps are confident about a Nov. 3 victory for Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump’s campaign paraphernalia — hats, banners, mugs and practically anything else that can carry a logo — has been selling briskly at shops in the vast wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu. By contrast, shop owners said during recent visits, bulk orders for materials supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have been almost nonexistent.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’ve had four or five shoppers for Trump materials each month,” said Ge Lu, a salesman at one of about 100 shops specializing just in flags, referring to big purchasers who buy banners by the thousands. “We’ve had one Biden shopper this year.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The place isn’t for the average shopper. Yiwu is home to the world’s largest wholesale market, where global retailers look for items to stock on their own shelves. In building after cavernous building, buyers for companies big and small pick through stalls featuring hats, T-shirts, banners, face masks, baby toys, knapsacks, modeling clay and practically any other manufactured product that will delight the world’s fickle consumers.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             It is also home to what Chinese watchers of American politics — a nervous group these days, given souring relations between the two countries and Beijing’s tighter limits on conversation — call the Yiwu Index. Big demand for a presidential candidate’s merchandise, goes the theory, translates into big voter turnout in November.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now, according to the informal and highly unscientific index, Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden substantially.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Trump still has the better chance,” said Zhang Zhijiang, the owner of a caps and hats factory in Jiangsu Province who keeps a sales office in the Yiwu market.

             Followers of the Yiwu Index believe it is reliable, however, and they have history on their side. In 2016, the index consistently predicted a Trump victory. In the final weeks of the campaign, demand for Hillary Clinton hats and other souvenirs weakened considerably.

             China is watching the election nervously. Mr. Trump launched a trade war against Beijing and has taken a more confrontational approach on issues like high-tech export controls, industrial espionage, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, some in China expect little improvement under a Biden administration. They worry that Mr. Biden might even

             Formally named the Yiwu International Trade City, it boasts 12 times the floor space of the Empire State Building, making it look like a small city. Much of the complex was hastily and even shoddily built two decades ago, giving its prematurely aging buildings a ramshackle look.

             It has 70,000 shops, and transactions taking place under its many roofs exceed $60 billion a year. The national government considers the market enough of an indicator of the health of light manufacturing that it manages its own Yiwu Index, of average prices at the shops.

             With some disorderly exceptions, floors are organized by type of merchandise. The warren-like corridors of one floor were devoted to hats. A second housed flags. A third floor featured costumes and masks, while another was devoted to toys.

            <p>
             Ms. Dai, the owner of the baseball cap factory in Qingdao, rents a stall on the hat floor. She said orders for Trump baseball caps had been consistently strong for two years. Biden cap orders were negligible until he became the expected Democratic nominee last spring, but only in recent weeks have these customers wanted to put down cash, she added. The recent orders arrived too late to make and deliver the hats before the election.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the total for Trump cap orders so far this year: “There are tens of thousands this year,” Ms. Dai said. “Biden has a few thousand.”

             Despite its accuracy in 2016, the Yiwu political index has its flaws. Often the buyers are not the campaigns themselves but proxies, like companies and other institutions that want to express their support for a candidate, or simply stores that want to sell popular merchandise.
            </p>
            <p>
             The pandemic has interfered with normal marketing. China has barred practically all international visitors since the end of March, and it has required stringent, two-week quarantines for those who do enter. This has reduced overall activity compared with the 2016 presidential campaign, merchants said.

             The pandemic has also produced different styles of campaigning. Mr. Trump has emphasized large gatherings, with supporters waving pennants and wearing various campaign merchandise, which increases demand for goods from Yiwu. Mr. Biden has avoided holding or encouraging mass gatherings in person and has relied more on online events.
            </p>
            <p>
             As in 2016, Mr. Trump also appears to be gaining a considerable share of his support from people in rural areas, where people may have more room for yard signs and banners. Mr. Biden has done better in cities, where apartment dwellers have less room to wave flags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some vendors think Mr. Biden’s supporters may simply be taking business elsewhere. Mr. Zhang, the hat factory owner in Jiangsu Province, said Biden supporters appeared to be placing more of their baseball cap orders in Vietnam and Myanmar.
            </p>
            <p>
             With trade with the United States increasingly in doubt, a few Yiwu vendors said they were becoming less interested in the American market. In the flag section, some appeared to be appealing instead to China’s rising nationalism. On the flag floor, the corridors were a scarlet sea of red national flags, red Chinese Communist Party pennants and other souvenirs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet Trump paraphernalia is still in demand. At a Halloween mask factory outlet, rubbery Trump masks were consistently popular and completely sold out.
            </p>
            <p>
             The factory created a Biden mask, said Gigi Zhang, the store manager, but nobody had ordered it yet.

<p>
WASHINGTON — America’s two major parties had hoped the 2020 presidential election would render a decisive judgment on the country’s political trajectory. But after a race that broke records for voter turnout and campaign spending, neither Democrats nor Republicans have achieved a dominant upper hand.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the election delivered a split decision, ousting President Trump but narrowing the Democratic majority in the House and perhaps preserving the Republican majority in the Senate. As Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepares to take office and preside over a closely divided government, leaders in both camps are acknowledging that voters seem to have issued not a mandate for the left or the right but a muddled plea to move on from Trump-style chaos.
</p>
<p>
With 306 electoral college votes and the most popular votes of any presidential candidate in history, Mr. Biden attained a victory that was paramount to many Democrats, who saw a second Trump term as nothing less than a threat to democracy
<strong>
.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yet on the electoral landscape, both parties find themselves stretched thin and battling on new fronts, with their traditional strongholds increasingly under siege. Indeed, Democrats and Republicans are facing perhaps the most unsettled and up-for-grabs electoral map the country has seen in a generation, since the parties were still fighting over California in the late 1980s.
<br>
</p>
<p>
This competition has denied either from being able to claim broad majorities and prompted a series of election cycles, which could be repeated in 2022, in which any gains Democrats make in the country’s booming cities and states are at least partly offset by growing Republican strength in rural areas.
</p>
<p>
The election represented a continuation of this trench warfare between two parties that are increasingly defined by their activist flanks and limited to only incremental advances.
</p>
<p>
“We are more divided than any other time in my lifetime,” said Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and Republican National Committee chair, whose first job in politics was on Richard M. Nixon’s 1968 campaign. “But usually when we’re at parity we’re bunched up in the middle — now we’ve got parity but with extreme polarity.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden and the Democrats viewed this election as an opportunity to deliver a crushing repudiation to Republicans and the movement known as Trumpism, while Mr. Trump and his allies saw the chance to cement a durable governing coalition led by the far right.
</p>
<p>
Neither party got all it wanted. Democrats improved considerably on their performance in the last presidential race, repairing their standing in the Midwest, building their strength in the Sun Belt. Yet voters in Ohio, Iowa and Florida delivered a stinging rebuke to the idea the Democrats would pick off increasingly conservative states.
</p>
<p>
The G.O.P. defied expectations and gained seats in the House, limited their losses in the Senate and protected critical state legislative majorities. But they experienced troubling erosion in the South and West as Mr. Biden won Arizona and Georgia.
</p>
<p>
As the results come into sharper focus, a more sober mood has set in on both sides of the aisle.
</p>
<p>
Unless Democrats can win a pair of Senate seats in Georgia’s January runoff elections, Mr. Biden will arrive in the White House facing the same circumstances his predecessors have for eight of the last 10 years: an executive branch controlled by one party and part or all of the legislative branch held by the other.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden, elected officials and strategists in both parties agree, will most likely have a limited window upon taking office to show he can lead successfully. If he can bridge Washington’s bitter partisan divides to craft successful policies to fight the coronavirus pandemic and revive the economy, he may well have a chance to transform his party’s loose anti-Trump coalition into a more stable electoral majority.

<p>
Already, there are mounting signs of just how difficult it may be for either party to govern through pragmatism and compromise. With Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede the election and his talk of running again in 2024, Republicans are worried about Trumpian retribution if they break with a leader who remains the cultural and ideological lodestar of the G.O.P. base.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Mr. Trump’s defeat this month has removed the single most important force holding the Democratic Party’s eclectic coalition together: the president himself. With his ouster, the détente that persisted throughout the year between the Democratic left and center has begun to crumble, with open sniping and blame-casting between figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the party’s most prominent young progressive, and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist of vital importance to Mr. Biden’s agenda in the Senate.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen whether either party will embrace a head-on reckoning with its own electoral vulnerabilities. Moderate Democrats have mostly just criticized the party’s left wing for having promoted stances that they believe cost them seats in Congress, while Republicans have largely remained silent on Mr. Trump’s intransigence and conspiracy-mongering.
</p>
<p>
While Mr. Biden rebuilt the Democrats’ Blue Wall — reclaiming the swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — he carried them by a fraction of the margins former President Barack Obama achieved in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. As long as Republicans manage to amass enormous leads with working-class white voters, those states may not be safely Democratic anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
Just as troubling to the party, Democrats sagged with voters of color, particularly in Hispanic and Asian-American communities where Republicans’ attacks on Democrats as a left-wing party appear to have resonated, denying Mr. Biden a victory in Florida and costing the Democrats congressional seats in that state as well as Texas and California. Indeed, the only House seats Republicans picked up that were not in districts Mr. Trump also carried were in heavily Hispanic or Asian regions.
</p>
<p>
On a Democratic conference call this past week, Representative Linda Sanchez, a former member of the House leadership, criticized Democrats’ Latino outreach strategy as a dismal failure, according to two people who participated on the call. And Representative Donna Shalala of Florida, who lost her seat in a heavily Hispanic district, complained on the call that her party did not effectively rebut Republicans’ portrayal of Democrats as socialists.
</p>
<p>
“Defund police, open borders, socialism — it’s killing us,” said Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat from South Texas who won just over 50 percent of the vote two years after he nearly captured 60 percent. “I had to fight to explain all that.”
</p>
<p>
The “average white person,” Mr. Gonzalez added, may associate socialism with Nordic countries, but to Asian and Hispanic migrants it recalls despotic “left-wing regimes.”
</p>
<p>
Representative Harley Rouda of California, an Orange County Democrat who narrowly lost his bid for re-election, said the party needed to deliver a more assertive and moderate message if it wanted to claim districts like his. Mr. Rouda, who is planning to run again in 2022, said he suffered with centrist voters and his district’s numerous Vietnamese-American voters, many of whom recoil from the rhetoric of socialism.
</p>
<p>
“This narrative that the Democratic Party is borderline socialist, we need to fight back harder on that because it’s simply not true,” he said. “We needed to be more forceful in defending the moderate position of the Democratic Party as a whole.”
</p>
<p>
Chuck Rocha, a longtime Democratic consultant, said too many white Democrats “see Black and brown people as the same” instead of approaching Hispanics as people open to either party and
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/opinion/biden-latino-vote-strategy.html\" title=\"\">
in need of convincing.
</a>
</p>
<p>
“Our community is not a get-out-the-vote universe,” said Mr. Rocha, alluding to voters almost certain to support Democrats if they show up at the polls. “We’re a persuasion universe and should be treated like whites.”

<p>
Yet if Republicans cling to Mr. Trump, or to his brand of crude nationalism, they will continue to alienate voters in the fast-growing South and West who helped hand Mr. Biden Arizona and Georgia. As Mr. Biden showed, there are hordes of swing voters who find Mr. Trump and his divisive politics even more offensive than the slogans of the hard left.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden’s map-stretching victories were not isolated events. They cap a steady expansion of Democratic strength, especially in the West, where the party has gained four Senate seats since 2016: two in Arizona, and one each in Colorado and Nevada.
</p>
<p>
State Senator J.D. Mesnard of Arizona, a Republican who won a difficult race for re-election this month, said his state had clearly become “more competitive,” though he argued that down-ballot results suggested voters hadn’t abandoned the party entirely.
</p>
<p>
“You see similar things in Georgia and North Carolina — states that have seen a lot of growth,” Mr. Mesnard said. “A lot of these places that were pretty hard-core red are now on the bubble.”
</p>
<p>
The deeper problem for Republicans is the powerful grip Mr. Trump retains on the party — exactly the factor that made those states competitive.
</p>
<p>
Among Republicans, there is a stark difference between how lawmakers who are nearing retirement age or are safely ensconced in their seats approach Mr. Trump and how those who still require his favor speak of him.

Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Senate Republican whose term is up in 2022, insisted that “the Republican Party is the Republican Party, it’s no one man’s party.”
</p>
<p>
And Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who just won
re-election without ever endorsing Mr. Trump, said the president “is an important voice but not the dominant voice in party,” pointing to “next generation” figures like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
</p>
<p>
“It’s President Trump’s supporters’ party,” said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who faces re-election in 2022, adding, “That’s a group of people I think the Republican Party wants to hang onto.”
</p>
<p>
For Democrats, the election has illustrated the fragility of their coalition.
</p>
<p>
With Mr. Biden racking up overwhelming margins in Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee — and even winning metropolitan Phoenix and Atlanta — progressives have become angered by the party establishment’s complaints about the issues energizing activists.

“While there is a lot of sniping at defund the police, Medicare for all, the Green New Deal and things like that, we also have to recognize that the Black Lives Matter movement was a seminal moment for the country and it also boosted Democratic registration and turnout across the country,” said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus.
</p>
<p>
National Democrats, meanwhile, were shocked that Republicans made incremental gains with voters of color, especially in a campaign pitting Mr. Trump’s incendiary persona against Mr. Biden’s message of racial-justice message. That development challenged some of the party’s basic cultural assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Longtime lawmakers in both parties expressed guarded optimism that the depth of the country’s crises would at least initially force consensus and action, adding that their side would pay a political price if they are seen as obstructionists.
</p>
<p>
“They may not want to compromise with Mitch McConnell, but their choice is doing nothing that improves people’s lives or trying to find a way to compromise,” Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said of her party’s left.
</p>
<p>
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Republican, argued that it would be folly during simultaneous health and economic calamities for Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to reprise his strategy of denying Mr. Biden bipartisan success the way he did with Mr. Obama.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to have a tough map in the midterms and we need to get some stuff done,” said Mr. Cole. “Next year we better start governing in a normal way.”
</p>
<p>
The question for both parties is how they can satisfy voters who are pulling further apart, energizing their base without alienating a bigger share of the electorate.
<br>
</p>
<p>
”The more outrageous one sounds, the greater exposure they get to the public,” said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Missouri Democrat, lamenting the modern incentive structure in politics. “But it just deepens the divisions and worsens the climate in the country.”

            <p>
             WASHINGTON — America’s two major parties had hoped the 2020 presidential election would render a decisive judgment on the country’s political trajectory. But after a race that broke records for voter turnout and campaign spending, neither Democrats nor Republicans have achieved a dominant upper hand.
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead, the election delivered a split decision, ousting President Trump but narrowing the Democratic majority in the House and perhaps preserving the Republican majority in the Senate. As Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepares to take office and preside over a closely divided government, leaders in both camps are acknowledging that voters seem to have issued not a mandate for the left or the right but a muddled plea to move on from Trump-style chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
             With 306 electoral college votes and the most popular votes of any presidential candidate in history, Mr. Biden attained a victory that was paramount to many Democrats, who saw a second Trump term as nothing less than a threat to democracy
             <strong>
              .
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet on the electoral landscape, both parties find themselves stretched thin and battling on new fronts, with their traditional strongholds increasingly under siege. Indeed, Democrats and Republicans are facing perhaps the most unsettled and up-for-grabs electoral map the country has seen in a generation, since the parties were still fighting over California in the late 1980s.
             <br>
             </p>
           <p>
             This competition has denied either from being able to claim broad majorities and prompted a series of election cycles, which could be repeated in 2022, in which any gains Democrats make in the country’s booming cities and states are at least partly offset by growing Republican strength in rural areas.
            </p>
           
          
           
            <p>
             The election represented a continuation of this trench warfare between two parties that are increasingly defined by their activist flanks and limited to only incremental advances.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We are more divided than any other time in my lifetime,” said Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and Republican National Committee chair, whose first job in politics was on Richard M. Nixon’s 1968 campaign. “But usually when we’re at parity we’re bunched up in the middle — now we’ve got parity but with extreme polarity.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden and the Democrats viewed this election as an opportunity to deliver a crushing repudiation to Republicans and the movement known as Trumpism, while Mr. Trump and his allies saw the chance to cement a durable governing coalition led by the far right.
            </p>
            <p>
             Neither party got all it wanted. Democrats improved considerably on their performance in the last presidential race, repairing their standing in the Midwest, building their strength in the Sun Belt. Yet voters in Ohio, Iowa and Florida delivered a stinging rebuke to the idea the Democrats would pick off increasingly conservative states.
            </p>
            <p>
             The G.O.P. defied expectations and gained seats in the House, limited their losses in the Senate and protected critical state legislative majorities. But they experienced troubling erosion in the South and West as Mr. Biden won Arizona and Georgia.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             As the results come into sharper focus, a more sober mood has set in on both sides of the aisle.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless Democrats can win a pair of Senate seats in Georgia’s January runoff elections, Mr. Biden will arrive in the White House facing the same circumstances his predecessors have for eight of the last 10 years: an executive branch controlled by one party and part or all of the legislative branch held by the other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden, elected officials and strategists in both parties agree, will most likely have a limited window upon taking office to show he can lead successfully. If he can bridge Washington’s bitter partisan divides to craft successful policies to fight the coronavirus pandemic and revive the economy, he may well have a chance to transform his party’s loose anti-Trump coalition into a more stable electoral majority.

            <p>
             Already, there are mounting signs of just how difficult it may be for either party to govern through pragmatism and compromise. With Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede the election and his talk of running again in 2024, Republicans are worried about Trumpian retribution if they break with a leader who remains the cultural and ideological lodestar of the G.O.P. base.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, Mr. Trump’s defeat this month has removed the single most important force holding the Democratic Party’s eclectic coalition together: the president himself. With his ouster, the détente that persisted throughout the year between the Democratic left and center has begun to crumble, with open sniping and blame-casting between figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the party’s most prominent young progressive, and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist of vital importance to Mr. Biden’s agenda in the Senate.
            </p>
            <p>
             It remains to be seen whether either party will embrace a head-on reckoning with its own electoral vulnerabilities. Moderate Democrats have mostly just criticized the party’s left wing for having promoted stances that they believe cost them seats in Congress, while Republicans have largely remained silent on Mr. Trump’s intransigence and conspiracy-mongering.
            </p>
            <p>
             While Mr. Biden rebuilt the Democrats’ Blue Wall — reclaiming the swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — he carried them by a fraction of the margins former President Barack Obama achieved in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. As long as Republicans manage to amass enormous leads with working-class white voters, those states may not be safely Democratic anytime soon.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Just as troubling to the party, Democrats sagged with voters of color, particularly in Hispanic and Asian-American communities where Republicans’ attacks on Democrats as a left-wing party appear to have resonated, denying Mr. Biden a victory in Florida and costing the Democrats congressional seats in that state as well as Texas and California. Indeed, the only House seats Republicans picked up that were not in districts Mr. Trump also carried were in heavily Hispanic or Asian regions.
            </p>
            <p>
             On a Democratic conference call this past week, Representative Linda Sanchez, a former member of the House leadership, criticized Democrats’ Latino outreach strategy as a dismal failure, according to two people who participated on the call. And Representative Donna Shalala of Florida, who lost her seat in a heavily Hispanic district, complained on the call that her party did not effectively rebut Republicans’ portrayal of Democrats as socialists.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Defund police, open borders, socialism — it’s killing us,” said Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat from South Texas who won just over 50 percent of the vote two years after he nearly captured 60 percent. “I had to fight to explain all that.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The “average white person,” Mr. Gonzalez added, may associate socialism with Nordic countries, but to Asian and Hispanic migrants it recalls despotic “left-wing regimes.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Representative Harley Rouda of California, an Orange County Democrat who narrowly lost his bid for re-election, said the party needed to deliver a more assertive and moderate message if it wanted to claim districts like his. Mr. Rouda, who is planning to run again in 2022, said he suffered with centrist voters and his district’s numerous Vietnamese-American voters, many of whom recoil from the rhetoric of socialism.
            </p>
            <p>
             “This narrative that the Democratic Party is borderline socialist, we need to fight back harder on that because it’s simply not true,” he said. “We needed to be more forceful in defending the moderate position of the Democratic Party as a whole.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Chuck Rocha, a longtime Democratic consultant, said too many white Democrats “see Black and brown people as the same” instead of approaching Hispanics as people open to either party and
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/opinion/biden-latino-vote-strategy.html\" title=\"\">

            <p>
             “Our community is not a get-out-the-vote universe,” said Mr. Rocha, alluding to voters almost certain to support Democrats if they show up at the polls. “We’re a persuasion universe and should be treated like whites.”

             Yet if Republicans cling to Mr. Trump, or to his brand of crude nationalism, they will continue to alienate voters in the fast-growing South and West who helped hand Mr. Biden Arizona and Georgia. As Mr. Biden showed, there are hordes of swing voters who find Mr. Trump and his divisive politics even more offensive than the slogans of the hard left.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden’s map-stretching victories were not isolated events. They cap a steady expansion of Democratic strength, especially in the West, where the party has gained four Senate seats since 2016: two in Arizona, and one each in Colorado and Nevada.
            </p>
            <p>
             State Senator J.D. Mesnard of Arizona, a Republican who won a difficult race for re-election this month, said his state had clearly become “more competitive,” though he argued that down-ballot results suggested voters hadn’t abandoned the party entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You see similar things in Georgia and North Carolina — states that have seen a lot of growth,” Mr. Mesnard said. “A lot of these places that were pretty hard-core red are now on the bubble.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The deeper problem for Republicans is the powerful grip Mr. Trump retains on the party — exactly the factor that made those states competitive.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Among Republicans, there is a stark difference between how lawmakers who are nearing retirement age or are safely ensconced in their seats approach Mr. Trump and how those who still require his favor speak of him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Senate Republican whose term is up in 2022, insisted that “the Republican Party is the Republican Party, it’s no one man’s party.”
            </p>

             re-election without ever endorsing Mr. Trump, said the president “is an important voice but not the dominant voice in party,” pointing to “next generation” figures like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It’s President Trump’s supporters’ party,” said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who faces re-election in 2022, adding, “That’s a group of people I think the Republican Party wants to hang onto.”
            </p>
            <p>
             For Democrats, the election has illustrated the fragility of their coalition.
            </p>
            <p>
             With Mr. Biden racking up overwhelming margins in Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee — and even winning metropolitan Phoenix and Atlanta — progressives have become angered by the party establishment’s complaints about the issues energizing activists.

            </p>
            <p>
             “They may not want to compromise with Mitch McConnell, but their choice is doing nothing that improves people’s lives or trying to find a way to compromise,” Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said of her party’s left.
            </p>
            <p>
             Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Republican, argued that it would be folly during simultaneous health and economic calamities for Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to reprise his strategy of denying Mr. Biden bipartisan success the way he did with Mr. Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’re going to have a tough map in the midterms and we need to get some stuff done,” said Mr. Cole. “Next year we better start governing in a normal way.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The question for both parties is how they can satisfy voters who are pulling further apart, energizing their base without alienating a bigger share of the electorate.
             <br>
             </p>
            <p>
             ”The more outrageous one sounds, the greater exposure they get to the public,” said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Missouri Democrat, lamenting the modern incentive structure in politics. “But it just deepens the divisions and worsens the climate in the country.”

But I look at the good side and there’s a lot of good people here. A lot.” “Yes, it matters that we are a united country. If we don’t stand for something, we’ll fall for anything.”

Presidential Transition Live Updates: Choreographing Policy Steps, Biden and Team Look Ahead

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has kept a low public profile since her acceptance speech last weekend. The election raises the question of whether the Republican strategy of voter restrictions served the party’s interests as it once did.

<p>
With the presidential election essentially in the rearview, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his administration have begun looking forward, choreographing the policy steps they could take in a government no longer under the direction of President Trump.
</p>
<p>
Ron Klain, who Mr. Biden
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/us/politics/ron-klain-biden.html\" title=\"\">
announced last week would be his chief of staff
</a>
, is scheduled to appear on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, where he is expected to discuss plans to address the surging coronavirus outbreak alongside Michael Osterholm, a member of Mr. Biden’s coronavirus advisory team.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Klain served as the “Ebola czar” under President Barack Obama when the Ebola outbreak temporarily threatened to spill into the United States, and Mr. Biden’s coronavirus plans draw heavily from Mr. Klain’s experience. An average of more than 1,000 Americans are dying of the coronavirus every day, a 50 percent increase in the last month, and on Friday, the United States shattered yet another record, recording
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">
181,194 cases in a single day
</a>
, according to data compiled by The New York Times.
</p>
<p>
However, if Mr. Biden is to enact even mildly ambitious coronavirus relief efforts, he will need the support of two Democratic candidates facing
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/us/politics/georgia-runoffs-senate-control.html\" title=\"\">
runoffs for Senate seats in Georgia
</a>
in January. Both those candidates — Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock — are scheduled to give their appraisals of that race on Sunday television as well.
</p>
<p>
But while the pandemic and the economic fallout it has caused are likely to command the attention of Mr. Biden and his top advisers for some time, the president-elect has also stated other policy goals that he is expected to develop in the weeks ahead.
</p>
<p>
Chief among them is immigration. Mr. Biden has made clear his intent to do away with some of the most restrictive immigration policies put in place under Mr. Trump, but that would require reorienting multiple agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, that have focused narrowly on many of the president’s campaign promises over the past four years.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden stayed relatively tight-lipped about the members of his inner circle and their plans while the final votes were counted in battleground states last week. But since he has now won more electoral votes in Georgia and Arizona, the details of his plans may begin to emerge.

<p>
WASHINGTON — It was an election where Republican charges of fictitious voter fraud took center stage before, during and after the count, backed by a barrage of lawsuits intent on making it harder to cast or tally votes.
</p>
<p>
Yet by its end, Americans had cast ballots at a rate not seen in a century. A Democrat was elected president. And Republicans drew surprising support from Black and Latino voters — the very groups the party historically targeted with restrictive voting laws in state after state.
</p>
<p>
That a strategy Republicans long relied on largely fell flat, experts say, can be explained by the partisan divisions that drove record turnout, by self-inflicted wounds on the part of President Trump and by a pandemic that turned a gradual trend toward voting early — by mail or in person — into a stampede.
</p>
<p>
Some of those factors may be one-offs. But aspects of this election — especially the shift from Election Day voting to mail ballots, and the party’s gains with some racial groups — raise questions of whether the Republican strategy of voter restrictions served the party’s interests as it once did. Also unclear is whether the changes in how people voted this year, in the middle of a pandemic, reflect long-term changes pointing to higher turnouts or factors unique to the 2020 vote.
</p>
<p>
“As long as the Republican Party is going to depend on whiter, older and more rural electorate,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, “they’re going to make it harder for some people to register and vote.” Assertions of fraud, he said, fire up loyalists, increase political contributions and delegitimize Democratic victories.
</p>
<p>
“Already,” Dr. Hasen said, “Biden is going to come into office with millions of people believing falsely that he cheated his way into the presidency.”
</p>
<p>
But the election also highlighted how trying to place limits on casting a ballot might actually motivate voters to turn out. And even ignoring the toxic effects on democracy, some experts say, this was an election in which the results suggested that the Republican voting playbook may no longer be as effective as before.

<p>
WASHINGTON — In the days since he prevailed in the election, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made several public remarks and released summaries of his calls with foreign leaders as reporters track his every public movement. But Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has barely appeared on the public radar since her acceptance speech on Nov. 7 in Wilmington, Del., where she declared “a new day for America.”
</p>
<p>
She shared a stage again with Mr. Biden in Wilmington two days later, after a coronavirus briefing they had attended together. Ms. Harris stood silently several feet away while Mr. Biden spoke, without giving remarks of her own.
</p>
<p>
It is not unprecedented for a vice president-elect to keep a low profile in an election’s aftermath. “You know, you’ve been fairly invisible since the election,” the ABC News host George Stephanopoulos said to Mr. Biden in an interview more than a month after his own election as Barack Obama’s vice president.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden replied by insisting he had “been in the room” for every one of Mr. Obama’s important transition meetings. Because of social-distancing restrictions related to the coronavirus, Ms. Harris has no such luxury, at least not in the physical sense.
</p>
<p>
After spending election week in Delaware, she has returned to the two-bedroom Washington condominium she bought after she was elected to the Senate in 2016. From there, she is in regular touch with Mr. Biden, by text message or telephone, according to aides with the Biden-Harris transition team, and with other transition officials.
</p>
<p>
One focus of her time is the quantum leap Ms. Harris is soon to make from the legislative to the executive branch. Whereas Mr. Biden will have virtually no learning curve upon returning to the White House after eight years as vice president, Ms. Harris has spent little, if any, substantive time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. (A transition official could not immediately say when she had last visited there.)
</p>
<p>
That process is made no easier by President Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the election results and authorize an official transition process in which Ms. Harris and her aides would have access to White House officials and documents. Ms. Harris has not been contacted by her departing counterpart, Vice President Mike Pence. Days after the 2016 election, Mr. Biden hosted Mr. Pence for nearly two hours at the official vice-presidential compound at the U.S. Naval Observatory.

WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared to briefly acknowledge for the first time Sunday morning that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated him in the presidential election, but quickly reversed himself less than two hours later, insisting that “I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.”
</p>
<p>
The dueling tweets came as Mr. Trump continued to lie about the conduct of the vote-counting process, falsely insisting that Mr. Biden’s victory was the result of a “Rigged” election orchestrated by the “Fake &amp; Silent” media.
</p>
<p>
His
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327956491056279552?s=20\" title=\"\">
first tweet
</a>
came Sunday morning at 7:47. Referring to Mr. Biden, the president said that “he won.” That represented the first time Mr. Trump had publicly said what his advisers have been telling him for days privately: His re-election bid failed and Mr. Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20.
</p>
<p>
After a flurry of tweets and news reports about his “concession,” Mr. Trump insisted that he had been misunderstood.
</p>
<p>
At 9:16, he insisted falsely: “RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!” And three minutes later, he wrote that Mr. Biden “only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!”
</p>
<p>
The rapid online flip-flop made it clear that Mr. Trump is still refusing to abandon the lies about the election being rigged and stolen that he has been spreading since Election Day, inflaming anger among his supporters about his defeat.
</p>
<p>
In the same tweet in which he appeared to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory, Mr. Trump claimed again that “all of the mechanical ‘glitches’ that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes.” Twitter quickly labeled almost all of Mr. Trump’s Sunday morning tweets “disputed.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trump’s online commentary followed a series of tweets on Saturday in which he egged on thousands of his supporters at a
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/14/us/joe-biden-trump#thousands-rally-in-washington-as-clashes-erupt\" title=\"\">
pro-Trump gathering in Washington
</a>
with fake allegations about voter fraud as he continued to push legal challenges and deny that Mr. Biden was the president-elect.
</p>
<p>
“The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time,” Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon, making false claims about election officials in that state where a recount had been called by Brad Raffensberger, a Republican and the state’s secretary of state. “They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!”
</p>
<p>
After reports of some violent clashes between the president’s supporters in Washington and anti-Trump activists, Mr. Trump did not seek to calm tensions but instead lashed out, saying that “ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills,” and urged the police to move in aggressively.
</p>
<p>
“DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!” the president wrote.
</p>
<p>
It appears certain that the president’s initial Twitter acknowledgment of Mr. Biden’s victory was not an indication that he intends to offer a more formal concession any time in the near future. And there was no indication that his tweet would immediately cause

</p>
<p>
Mr. Trump played golf at his Virginia club on Saturday. He had no public events on his official schedule for Sunday.

Twelve days after the election, the results are increasingly clear: Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the presidency by a significant margin, growing his Electoral College lead with wins in Georgia and Arizona. Democrats kept control of the House but with a smaller majority, and control of the Senate will hinge on runoffs in January for Georgia’s two seats.
</p>
<p>
But 12 House contests remain uncalled. Here’s an overview of the vote counts in the House races as of Sunday morning.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
California, 21st District:
</strong>
Republican David Valadao is leading Representative T.J. Cox, a Democrat, by 1.4 percentage points with over 98 percent of estimated votes reported.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
California, 25th District:
</strong>
Representative Mike Garcia, a Republican, is leading Christy Smith, a Democrat, by just three-hundredths of a percentage point — 104 votes — with more than 98 percent of estimated votes reported.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, is leading Rita Hart, a Democrat, by two-hundredths of a percentage point — just 48 votes — with 89 percent of estimated votes reported.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
New Jersey, Seventh District:
</strong>
Representative Tom Malinowski, a Democrat, is leading Thomas Kean, a Republican, by one percentage point with 96 percent of estimated votes counted. The Associated Press called this race for Mr. Malinowski days ago, but the race has tightened since then, and The Times has withdrawn its call.
</p>
</li>

          With the presidential election essentially in the rearview, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his administration have begun looking forward, choreographing the policy steps they could take in a government no longer under the direction of President Trump.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ron Klain, who Mr. Biden
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/us/politics/ron-klain-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           announced last week would be his chief of staff
          </a>
          , is scheduled to appear on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, where he is expected to discuss plans to address the surging coronavirus outbreak alongside Michael Osterholm, a member of Mr. Biden’s coronavirus advisory team.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Klain served as the “Ebola czar” under President Barack Obama when the Ebola outbreak temporarily threatened to spill into the United States, and Mr. Biden’s coronavirus plans draw heavily from Mr. Klain’s experience. An average of more than 1,000 Americans are dying of the coronavirus every day, a 50 percent increase in the last month, and on Friday, the United States shattered yet another record, recording
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">
           181,194 cases in a single day
          </a>
          , according to data compiled by The New York Times.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, if Mr. Biden is to enact even mildly ambitious coronavirus relief efforts, he will need the support of two Democratic candidates facing
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/us/politics/georgia-runoffs-senate-control.html\" title=\"\">
           runoffs for Senate seats in Georgia
          </a>
          in January. Both those candidates — Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock — are scheduled to give their appraisals of that race on Sunday television as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          But while the pandemic and the economic fallout it has caused are likely to command the attention of Mr. Biden and his top advisers for some time, the president-elect has also stated other policy goals that he is expected to develop in the weeks ahead.
         </p>
         <p>
          Chief among them is immigration. Mr. Biden has made clear his intent to do away with some of the most restrictive immigration policies put in place under Mr. Trump, but that would require reorienting multiple agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, that have focused narrowly on many of the president’s campaign promises over the past four years.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden stayed relatively tight-lipped about the members of his inner circle and their plans while the final votes were counted in battleground states last week. But since he has now won more electoral votes in Georgia and Arizona, the details of his plans may begin to emerge.

         <p>
          WASHINGTON — It was an election where Republican charges of fictitious voter fraud took center stage before, during and after the count, backed by a barrage of lawsuits intent on making it harder to cast or tally votes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yet by its end, Americans had cast ballots at a rate not seen in a century. A Democrat was elected president. And Republicans drew surprising support from Black and Latino voters — the very groups the party historically targeted with restrictive voting laws in state after state.
         </p>
         <p>
          That a strategy Republicans long relied on largely fell flat, experts say, can be explained by the partisan divisions that drove record turnout, by self-inflicted wounds on the part of President Trump and by a pandemic that turned a gradual trend toward voting early — by mail or in person — into a stampede.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some of those factors may be one-offs. But aspects of this election — especially the shift from Election Day voting to mail ballots, and the party’s gains with some racial groups — raise questions of whether the Republican strategy of voter restrictions served the party’s interests as it once did. Also unclear is whether the changes in how people voted this year, in the middle of a pandemic, reflect long-term changes pointing to higher turnouts or factors unique to the 2020 vote.
         </p>
         <p>
          “As long as the Republican Party is going to depend on whiter, older and more rural electorate,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, “they’re going to make it harder for some people to register and vote.” Assertions of fraud, he said, fire up loyalists, increase political contributions and delegitimize Democratic victories.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Already,” Dr. Hasen said, “Biden is going to come into office with millions of people believing falsely that he cheated his way into the presidency.”
         </p>
         <p>
          But the election also highlighted how trying to place limits on casting a ballot might actually motivate voters to turn out. And even ignoring the toxic effects on democracy, some experts say, this was an election in which the results suggested that the Republican voting playbook may no longer be as effective as before.

          WASHINGTON — In the days since he prevailed in the election, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made several public remarks and released summaries of his calls with foreign leaders as reporters track his every public movement. But Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has barely appeared on the public radar since her acceptance speech on Nov. 7 in Wilmington, Del., where she declared “a new day for America.”
         </p>
         <p>
          She shared a stage again with Mr. Biden in Wilmington two days later, after a coronavirus briefing they had attended together. Ms. Harris stood silently several feet away while Mr. Biden spoke, without giving remarks of her own.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is not unprecedented for a vice president-elect to keep a low profile in an election’s aftermath. “You know, you’ve been fairly invisible since the election,” the ABC News host George Stephanopoulos said to Mr. Biden in an interview more than a month after his own election as Barack Obama’s vice president.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden replied by insisting he had “been in the room” for every one of Mr. Obama’s important transition meetings. Because of social-distancing restrictions related to the coronavirus, Ms. Harris has no such luxury, at least not in the physical sense.
         </p>
         <p>
          After spending election week in Delaware, she has returned to the two-bedroom Washington condominium she bought after she was elected to the Senate in 2016. From there, she is in regular touch with Mr. Biden, by text message or telephone, according to aides with the Biden-Harris transition team, and with other transition officials.
         </p>
         <p>
          One focus of her time is the quantum leap Ms. Harris is soon to make from the legislative to the executive branch. Whereas Mr. Biden will have virtually no learning curve upon returning to the White House after eight years as vice president, Ms. Harris has spent little, if any, substantive time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. (A transition official could not immediately say when she had last visited there.)
         </p>
         <p>
          That process is made no easier by President Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the election results and authorize an official transition process in which Ms. Harris and her aides would have access to White House officials and documents. Ms. Harris has not been contacted by her departing counterpart, Vice President Mike Pence. Days after the 2016 election, Mr. Biden hosted Mr. Pence for nearly two hours at the official vice-presidential compound at the U.S. Naval Observatory.

         <p>
          WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared to briefly acknowledge for the first time Sunday morning that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated him in the presidential election, but quickly reversed himself less than two hours later, insisting that “I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The dueling tweets came as Mr. Trump continued to lie about the conduct of the vote-counting process, falsely insisting that Mr. Biden’s victory was the result of a “Rigged” election orchestrated by the “Fake &amp; Silent” media.
         </p>
         <p>
          His
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327956491056279552?s=20\" title=\"\">
           first tweet
          </a>
          came Sunday morning at 7:47. Referring to Mr. Biden, the president said that “he won.” That represented the first time Mr. Trump had publicly said what his advisers have been telling him for days privately: His re-election bid failed and Mr. Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20.
         </p>
         <p>
          After a flurry of tweets and news reports about his “concession,” Mr. Trump insisted that he had been misunderstood.
         </p>
         <p>
          At 9:16, he insisted falsely: “RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!” And three minutes later, he wrote that Mr. Biden “only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!”
         </p>
         <p>
          The rapid online flip-flop made it clear that Mr. Trump is still refusing to abandon the lies about the election being rigged and stolen that he has been spreading since Election Day, inflaming anger among his supporters about his defeat.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the same tweet in which he appeared to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory, Mr. Trump claimed again that “all of the mechanical ‘glitches’ that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes.” Twitter quickly labeled almost all of Mr. Trump’s Sunday morning tweets “disputed.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Trump’s online commentary followed a series of tweets on Saturday in which he egged on thousands of his supporters at a

           pro-Trump gathering in Washington
          </a>
          with fake allegations about voter fraud as he continued to push legal challenges and deny that Mr. Biden was the president-elect.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time,” Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon, making false claims about election officials in that state where a recount had been called by Brad Raffensberger, a Republican and the state’s secretary of state. “They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!”
         </p>
         <p>
          After reports of some violent clashes between the president’s supporters in Washington and anti-Trump activists, Mr. Trump did not seek to calm tensions but instead lashed out, saying that “ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills,” and urged the police to move in aggressively.
         </p>
         <p>
          “DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!” the president wrote.
         </p>
         <p>
          It appears certain that the president’s initial Twitter acknowledgment of Mr. Biden’s victory was not an indication that he intends to offer a more formal concession any time in the near future. And there was no indication that his tweet would immediately cause
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/emily-murphy-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">

          Mr. Trump played golf at his Virginia club on Saturday. He had no public events on his official schedule for Sunday.

          Twelve days after the election, the results are increasingly clear: Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the presidency by a significant margin, growing his Electoral College lead with wins in Georgia and Arizona. Democrats kept control of the House but with a smaller majority, and control of the Senate will hinge on runoffs in January for Georgia’s two seats.

          But 12 House contests remain uncalled. Here’s an overview of the vote counts in the House races as of Sunday morning.

In Nancy Mitford’s comic 1960 novel “Don’t Tell Alfred,” the wife of the new British ambassador to Paris arrives at the embassy to find that she has a vexing problem: Her predecessor has refused to move out.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Pauline Leone, the wife of the previous ambassador, is so unhinged by the prospect of a status-free future that she has set up her own rival court, grandly receiving a stream of visitors as if for all the world she were still Madame L’Ambassadrice, the social arbiter of Paris.
</p>
<p>
“﻿At the beginning one thought it was a lark — that in a day or two she’d get tired of it,” a British official says crossly. But no. “She’s having the time of her life,” he adds, “and quite honestly I don’t see how we shall ever induce her to go.”
</p>
<p>
As the nation ponders the awkward case of Donald J. Trump, a president who will not admit that he has been fired, it is helpful to consider him through the experiences of other people, fictional and otherwise, who have been unable to accept the arrival of unwelcome developments in their personal and professional lives.
</p>
<p>
Is Trump like King Lear, raging naked on the heath and desperately hanging on to the increasingly diminished trappings of power even as they are stripped from him? Or is he more like Bartleby the Scrivener, the inscrutable model of passive resistance who one day declines to do any more work or indeed leave the building, declaring: “I would prefer not to?”
</p>
<p>
Is he like Nellie, the character in “The Office” who installs herself at the desk of the regional manager when he is out of town and unilaterally appoints herself boss? Or how about George from “Seinfeld,” who quits one of his many jobs in a huff, unsuccessfully tries to get it back, and reports to work anyway, as if nothing had happened?
</p>
<p>
Timothy Naftali, a history professor at New York University, said that one way to view Mr. Trump would be as a version of Miss Havisham, the jilted bride from “Great Expectations” who lives forever in the past, never taking off her tattered wedding gown even as her house decays around her.
</p>
<p>
“He’s wearing the cloak of the presidency and he’s stuck in his room, getting dusty, while everyone else has moved on,” Mr. Naftali said.
</p>
<p>
No president in American history has ever before refused for so long to concede an election he has obviously lost. But when it comes to hanging on to an alternative version of reality, Mr. Trump has plenty of nonpresidential company.

There was Eteocles, a son of Oedipus in Greek mythology, who remained on the throne of Thebes, reneging on his promise to share it with his twin brother, leading to a battle in which they killed each other.
</p>
<p>
There was Gov. Edmund J. Davis of Texas, a Republican, who refused to leave office after losing the election of 1873, claiming that he had several months left in his term and barricading himself on the ground floor of the State Capitol. (The newly elected governor and his supporters installed themselves on the first floor, using ladders to enter through the windows.)
</p>
<p>
There was the Hiroo Onoda, the Imperial Japanese Army officer
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/world/asia/hiroo-onoda-imperial-japanese-army-officer-dies-at-91.html\" title=\"\">
who would not surrender
</a>
after the end of World War II, remaining in combat-readiness in the jungle for 29 years until his by-then elderly former commanding officer arrived and rescinded his no-surrender order.
</p>
<p>
And there was the entire government of Moldova,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/europe/moldova-parliament-vladimir-plahotniuc.html\" title=\"\">
which in 2019 decided
</a>
not to make way for a new government, leading to a bizarre situation in which both groups claimed for a time to be in charge of the country. The impasse finally ended when the former prime minister grudgingly stepped down in the face of growing national outrage and international pressure.
</p>
<p>
While American presidential transfers of power have traditionally been smooth, well-run affairs, world history is replete with examples of dictators and strongmen employing nefarious means to remain in office. Sometimes such rulers refuse to accept the results of honestly conducted elections. Sometimes they throw out term limits, and just keep on governing. Sometimes they jail, torture, kill or disappear their political opponents. (Sometimes they do all of those things.)
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trump has spoken admiringly about at least some of these practices, saying, for instance, that he was
<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-negotiate-third-term-in-office-2020-9\" title=\"\">
“probably entitled” to a third term
</a>
“based on the way we were treated.” (That was before he lost the election.)
</p>

But given the news wafting like the occasional smoke signal from the White House, where some of the president’s advisers and relatives are reportedly attempting various psychological techniques to get Mr. Trump to accept the fact that he is now a lame-duck president, his behavior seems less like a putsch and more like an extended whiny tantrum. As Dan Rather, an elder statesman of American journalism,
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanRather/status/1327096726696542208\" title=\"\">
said on Twitter
</a>
: “Dude. You lost.”
</p>

<p>
“He cannot bear being the loser and so now is doing everything within his power to assault the reality he hates,” said Joseph Burgo, a clinical psychologist who has studied Mr. Trump and written about his appeal to voters.
</p>
<p>
“Once he has exhausted all possible avenues to challenge the election, he will spend the rest of his life insisting the system conspired to deprive him of his victory,” said Dr. Burgo, the author of “The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age.” “He will take refuge in blame, self-pity and righteous indignation to shore up his sense of self, thereby warding off the humiliation of true defeat.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, many Republican legislators, loath to upset Mr. Trump, are helping to prop up the illusion that he is still somehow in power, in a way reminiscent of the courtiers who flattered, lied and enabled their way through the final days of Emperor Haile Selasse’s reign in Ethiopia in Ryszard Kapuscinski’s “The Emperor.”
</p>
<p>
Interestingly enough, there appears to be some precedent for this within the Trump family itself. When the president’s father, Fred, developed Alzheimer’s, the family reportedly conspired to help him believe that he still ran the Trump organization. According to Vanity Fair,
<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/don-jr-thinks-trump-is-acting-crazy-presidents-covid-joyride-has-family-divided\" title=\"\">
the elder Mr. Trump would show up for work
</a>
every day, signing blank papers and using an office phone connected only to his secretary’s line. “Fred pretended to work,” a family friend told the magazine.
</p>
<p>
With his vast coterie of enablers willing to believe his baseless assertions about the election, Mr. Naftali said, Trump might be better compared to the Wizard in “The Wizard of Oz.”
</p>
<p>
“Many of us assumed that Trump’s behind-the-curtain moment — when Dorothy arrived and, thanks to Toto, found out that the Wizard was a humbug — would come because of his handling of the Covid emergency,” he said. “But one of the reasons the president is able to continue this fantasy that he won a second term is that 73 million people don’t agree that he was a humbug. Even though the Wizard is on his way out, Oz still exists.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, angry people can be very dangerous when backed into corners, and Mr. Trump’s belief in his own falsehoods has already had damaging, real-life consequences. Some sympathetic right-wing media outlets and many Republican officials are refusing to acknowledge that Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the president-elect. Millions of people appear to believe Mr. Trump’s assertions that the election was stolen and that the coronavirus, now raging out of control, is not a serious problem. His supporters
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/us/politics/thousands-rally-in-washington-as-clashes-erupt.html\" title=\"\">
are marching in the streets
</a>
to protest the election result, and it remains to be seen under what circumstances he will finally leave the White House.
</p>
</div>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.7124600639\" morss_score=\"30.607196906\">
<p>
All these things raise the question (asking for a friend): How do you get someone to face reality and get out of the White House?
</p>
<p>
For clients who have lost their jobs during this unsettling time, said Megan Walls, an executive coach and career adviser in Chicago, she works to help them accept what has happened and move on. “The reality is that we can’t control Covid or jobs or business — we can only control ourselves,” she said.
</p>
<p>
However, she added, Mr. Trump would not be a good candidate for the kind of coaching she offers.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t work with people who are avoiding the situation or acting like a victim,” she said. “Anyone who is digging their heels in — I can’t help him until they help themselves. Maybe they don’t need a coach; they need a psychotherapist.”
</p>
<p>
How about flattery?

             In Nancy Mitford’s comic 1960 novel “Don’t Tell Alfred,” the wife of the new British ambassador to Paris arrives at the embassy to find that she has a vexing problem: Her predecessor has refused to move out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indeed, Pauline Leone, the wife of the previous ambassador, is so unhinged by the prospect of a status-free future that she has set up her own rival court, grandly receiving a stream of visitors as if for all the world she were still Madame L’Ambassadrice, the social arbiter of Paris.
            </p>
            <p>
             “﻿At the beginning one thought it was a lark — that in a day or two she’d get tired of it,” a British official says crossly. But no. “She’s having the time of her life,” he adds, “and quite honestly I don’t see how we shall ever induce her to go.”
            </p>
            <p>
             As the nation ponders the awkward case of Donald J. Trump, a president who will not admit that he has been fired, it is helpful to consider him through the experiences of other people, fictional and otherwise, who have been unable to accept the arrival of unwelcome developments in their personal and professional lives.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Is Trump like King Lear, raging naked on the heath and desperately hanging on to the increasingly diminished trappings of power even as they are stripped from him? Or is he more like Bartleby the Scrivener, the inscrutable model of passive resistance who one day declines to do any more work or indeed leave the building, declaring: “I would prefer not to?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Is he like Nellie, the character in “The Office” who installs herself at the desk of the regional manager when he is out of town and unilaterally appoints herself boss? Or how about George from “Seinfeld,” who quits one of his many jobs in a huff, unsuccessfully tries to get it back, and reports to work anyway, as if nothing had happened?
            </p>
            <p>
             Timothy Naftali, a history professor at New York University, said that one way to view Mr. Trump would be as a version of Miss Havisham, the jilted bride from “Great Expectations” who lives forever in the past, never taking off her tattered wedding gown even as her house decays around her.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He’s wearing the cloak of the presidency and he’s stuck in his room, getting dusty, while everyone else has moved on,” Mr. Naftali said.
            </p>
            <p>
             No president in American history has ever before refused for so long to concede an election he has obviously lost. But when it comes to hanging on to an alternative version of reality, Mr. Trump has plenty of nonpresidential company.

             There was Eteocles, a son of Oedipus in Greek mythology, who remained on the throne of Thebes, reneging on his promise to share it with his twin brother, leading to a battle in which they killed each other.

(The newly elected governor and his supporters installed themselves on the first floor, using ladders to enter through the windows.)

             </a>
             not to make way for a new government, leading to a bizarre situation in which both groups claimed for a time to be in charge of the country. The impasse finally ended when the former prime minister grudgingly stepped down in the face of growing national outrage and international pressure.

             While American presidential transfers of power have traditionally been smooth, well-run affairs, world history is replete with examples of dictators and strongmen employing nefarious means to remain in office. Sometimes such rulers refuse to accept the results of honestly conducted elections. Sometimes they throw out term limits, and just keep on governing. Sometimes they jail, torture, kill or disappear their political opponents. (Sometimes they do all of those things.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has spoken admiringly about at least some of these practices, saying, for instance, that he was
             <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-negotiate-third-term-in-office-2020-9\" title=\"\">
              “probably entitled” to a third term
             </a>
             “based on the way we were treated.” (That was before he lost the election.)

<p>
The trouble broke out inside the main counting room in Detroit late on the morning of Nov. 4.
</p>
<p>
It was the day after Election Day, and until then the process of tabulating votes from the city’s various counting boards had gone smoothly inside the TCF Center, the cavernous convention hall that plays host to the North American International Auto Show.
</p>
<p>
As batches of ballots came in by van, workers methodically inspected and registered them at 134 separate tables, each monitored by voting rights observers and so-called election challengers from each party.
</p>
<p>
But the posture of the Republican challengers shifted as the count swung in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and word spread that President Trump would sue. One witness, a nonpartisan observer, Julie Moroney, heard a Republican organizer say, “Now we’re going to challenge every ballot.”
</p>
<p>
Republican volunteers suddenly ramped up their objections across the room: accusations that the workers doing the counting were entering obviously incorrect birth years or backdating ballots. In some cases, the volunteers lodged blanket claims of wrongdoing.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing?” a worker asked a Republican observer who was challenging ballots before he was able to even begin to inspect them, a Democratic observer, Seth Furlow, recalled. The Republican observer responded, “I was told to challenge every one.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Furlow vividly recalled his discomfort with a scene in which mostly white Republican challengers were confronting the mostly Black elections workers.
</p>
<p>
Already, the police had escorted a handful of particularly disruptive observers from the room. But
<a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/11/06/tcf-center-detroit-ballot-counting/6173577002/\" title=\"\">
tensions increased
</a>
when election officials noticed that the number of challengers had grown well beyond what each side was permitted and barred entry in a bid to reduce their ranks. Shouts of “stop the count” went up among Republicans.
</p>
<p>
The fraud that the Republicans claimed to observe was not fraud at all, a Michigan state judge determined on Friday in rejecting a lawsuit filed by allies of Mr. Trump. The various instances of supposed malfeasance were in fact well-established procedures for dealing with the peculiarities of data entry, the correction of minor errors and protocols for social distancing — all intended to ensure a careful and accurate vote count.
</p>
<p>
But in the fact-twisting narrative of Mr. Trump, his political allies and his supporters, the Detroit counting center was a crime scene where Democrats stole an election, a miscarriage demanding that outrage be channeled through the courts, presidential Twitter posts and cable news stemwinders.
</p>
<p>
And that was the plan envisioned by the pro-Trump forces all along.

Like similar episodes in Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the scene in Detroit was the culmination of a yearslong strategy by Mr. Trump to use the power of the executive branch, an army of lawyers, the echo chamber of conservative news media and the obedience of fellow Republicans to try out his most audacious exercise in bending reality: to turn losing into winning.
</p>
<p>
Obscured by the postelection noise over the president’s efforts to falsely portray the election system as “rigged” against him has been how much Mr. Trump and his allies did ahead of time to promote a baseless conspiracy devised to appeal to his most passionate supporters, providing him with the opportunity to make his historically anomalous bid to cling to power in the face of defeat.
</p>
<p>
That bid is now in its last throes. Judges are

</a>
” who are alive — unravel. And yet Mr. Trump has still not given up on seeding doubt about the election’s integrity as he seeks to stain Mr. Biden’s clear victory — by more than
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html\" title=\"\">
5.5 million votes and also in the Electoral College
</a>
— with false insinuations of illegitimacy. On Sunday alone, he posted more than two dozen election-related tweets, seeming to briefly acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory before declaring, “
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327979630477922304?s=20\" title=\"\">
I concede NOTHING!
</a>
”
</p>
<p>
The roots of Mr. Trump’s approach date to before his election in 2016, and he advanced his plans throughout his term. But his strategy for casting doubt on the outcome of the 2020 campaign took shape in earnest when the coronavirus pandemic upended normal life and led states to promote voting by mail.
</p>
<p>
From the start, the president saw mail-in ballots as a political threat that would appeal more to Democrats than to his followers. And so he and his allies sought to block moves to make absentee voting easier and to slow the
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/02/magazine/vote-mail-postal-service.html\" title=\"\">
counting of mail ballots
</a>
. This allowed Mr. Trump to do two things: claim an early victory on election night and paint ballots that were counted later for his opponent as fraudulent.
</p>
<p>
The United States Postal Service, after coming under the leadership of a Trump ally, Louis DeJoy, made several cost-saving moves that severely slowed mail delivery rates and prompted broad
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/us/politics/mail-ballot-usps.html\" title=\"\">
concern about mail ballots arriving on time
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
In the Senate, under the leadership of Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, Republicans blocked Democratic efforts to get more money to states so they could buy more sorting equipment to count the huge influx of mail ballots faster.
</p>
<p>
In key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, Republican-controlled legislatures refused attempts by civil rights groups and Democrats to change or suspend statutes forbidding election workers from beginning to count ballots before Election Day. And once the counting began, the Trump campaign and the president’s allies pursued other tactics to slow or stop the count and seed doubt about the validity of the results.
</p>
<p>
Before Election Day, party officials at the state and national levels helped organize teams of observers, a role that was once a symbol of the transparency of American democracy. But in this case, Mr. Trump and his allies encouraged their observers in key states to act aggressively to stop what they portrayed as widespread cheating and provide information that could be fed into lawsuits and stoke demonstrations and coverage from friendly commentators and journalists.
</p>
<p>
As a Pennsylvania state senator, Mike Regan, a Republican, put it at a
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pennslinger/status/1325604097316302848\" title=\"\">
rally in Harrisburg
</a>
last week, “I’ve been told in no uncertain terms by the state party and by our leaders that they are coordinating with the Trump campaign, and so far Pennsylvania has done everything that the Trump campaign has asked them to do.”
</p>
<p>
Nearly all of it would be done in the name of a falsehood: that the American voting system was so corroded by fraud that any losing result for the president could not be legitimate.
</p>
<p>
There was no greater proponent of that notion than Mr. Trump, who promoted it heavily from behind his presidential lectern or from his phone. A presidency that began with a lie — that President Barack Obama was not a citizen — is now ending with one, too.
</p>

Mr. Trump acknowledged
</a>
in September 2016 that Mr. Obama was indeed born in the United States, he was well along in promoting a new false narrative that the election was rigged in favor of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.
</p>
<p>
Facing what he and the entire political world expected to be a loss, Mr. Trump repeated the claim regularly as international and domestic allies backed him up: the ambush-video activist

</p>
<p>
Mr. Trump’s Electoral College victory rendered those 2016 plans unnecessary. But the incoming president had reason to cling to the falsehood as a way to cast doubt on the reality that he had lost the popular vote by a margin of
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president\" title=\"\">
nearly three million
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trump even went so far as to impanel a presidential commission to endorse his charge about widespread voter fraud, led by Vice President Mike Pence and

Kris Kobach
</a>
, a former Kansas secretary of state and prominent supporter of the baseless idea that voter fraud is a national threat.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html\" title=\"\">
commission disbanded
</a>
amid lawsuits and dissension after several months without issuing findings. But internal documents later released through litigation showed that even before its work truly began it had worked up the outline for a

to claim systematic voter fraud and that it wanted to produce an
<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/03/what-is-kris-kobach-up-to-215332\" title=\"\">
extensive database
</a>
to identify fraudulent registrations using information from government agencies.
</p>
<p>
Such matching exercises are a necessary part of keeping voting lists accurate. But in recent years, sloppy data comparisons have resulted in erroneous but sensational-sounding claims of supposedly dead or noncitizen voters that repeatedly fell apart after close inspection.
</p>
<p>
Before the 2020 election, Republicans in several states pushed aggressive “purges” of their rolls based on such imprecise data matching, often with support from Mr. Trump, before embarrassing revelations that their lists were badly flawed and threatened to wrongfully remove legal voters from their rolls.
</p>
<p>
For instance, a poorly conducted data match led Texas to announce in early 2019 that it had identified some 95,000 “noncitizens” on its registration rolls. The state swiftly moved to strike these supposedly illegal voters — many of them Hispanic — from its lists as Mr. Trump
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089513936435716096?s=20\" title=\"\">
posted on Twitter
</a>
that “voter fraud is rampant.”
</p>
<p>
After further review,
<a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/02/01/texas-citizenship-voter-roll-review-how-it-turned-boondoggle/\" title=\"\">
Texas learned that its data was incorrect
</a>
, and civil rights groups successfully
<a href=\"https://www.maldef.org/2019/04/latino-voters-civil-rights-groups-reach-settlement-with-texas-over-purging-of-voter-rolls/\" title=\"\">

<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/16/group-seeks-remove-thousands-wisconsins-voter-rolls/3986444002/\" title=\"\">
delayed plans
</a>
for a large purge last year because of concern about the accuracy of the information, prompting a conservative lawsuit to push it forward, which is still pending.
</p>
<p>
By then, Wisconsin had emerged as a critical battleground for both parties, along with Pennsylvania and Michigan.
</p>
<p>
That November, Justin Clark, a senior Trump adviser, visited with Republicans in Madison, Wis., to emphasize just how important the state was to Mr. Trump’s prospects. He signaled how voter fraud allegations would be key to any Trump strategy in 2020, according to a recording that leaked to
<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/af2f0ede054d8baebbe1bb6ca47b4895\" title=\"\">
The Associated Press
</a>
in December.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Clark explained how a ruling from a voter intimidation case against Republicans in New Jersey in the early 1980s had led to a longstanding judicial decree forbidding the Republican National Committee from sending and organizing poll watchers in elections. But that decree finally lapsed in 2018, which,
<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am0egba-KNQ\" title=\"\">
Mr. Clark said
</a>
, gave the national party a new ability to send challengers into polls in 2020 and coordinate in every battleground state.
</p>
<p>
The challengers would be focused on Democratic “cheating,” he said. And the Republican Party would have an ability it never had before to blast those charges far and wide, through the social media accounts of the president of the United States.
</p>
<p>
“How many times do you have an issue in a county that is just egregious and terrible, but it never gets the attention it deserves, because the media won’t report it?” Mr. Clark told the Republicans. “We’ve got a guy who is committed to this, who is able to short-circuit media attention on stuff and just say things.”
</p>
<h3>
<span>
Clashes in the States
</span>
</h3>
<p>
Wisconsin was one of three key battleground states, along with Pennsylvania and Michigan, where the president had loyal allies who controlled the state legislatures but Democrats were in the governors’ mansions.
</p>
<p>
During the pandemic, that political dynamic generated clashes that grew more intense as the key role of mail-in balloting became apparent, with Democrats voting by mail in large numbers during primary elections in the spring. The need for more money and new procedures to help process mail ballots more quickly became evident.
</p>
<p>
An explosion of litigation and legislative maneuvering followed, in which voting rights groups and Democrats pressed to make it easier to cast and count mail ballots and Republicans pressed to keep deadlines and restrictions in place, saying they were to prevent fraud.

<p>
A case that reached the Supreme Court gave Wisconsin additional time to count ballots in its primary as the state struggled to conduct the election while the pandemic was raging.
</p>
<p>
After the Pennsylvania primary in June, Philadelphia officials counted for a week. In the State Legislature, negotiations began over changes that would allow the counting to run more smoothly in November.
</p>
<p>
Local election administrators and Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, sought to allow early processing of mail ballots, known as precanvassing, as early as three weeks before Election Day. Statehouse Republicans publicly signaled a willingness to work on the issue but kept attaching conditions.
</p>
<p>
One demand sought to do away with drop boxes, which voters could use for ballots as opposed to the regular mail system; another wanted new signature-matching requirements or to eradicate a provision requiring all poll watchers to live in the county.
</p>
<p>
“Every time we agreed to something that was put out there, they’d raise the bar,” said Jay Costa, the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate who was leading the negotiations.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, there seemed to be some momentum behind an agreement that would have allowed for three days of precanvassing, enhanced security measures for drop boxes and ballots postmarked on Election Day and received within three days to be counted. But the deal abruptly fell apart after a Republican caucus meeting in the lower chamber.
</p>
<p>
In Michigan, Republicans in the State Legislature conducted a similar dance, appearing to be willing to provide more time to begin processing ballots, only to negotiate the additional time down to just 10 hours and only in counties with more than 25,000 people.
</p>
<p>
Forced to accept the deal as better than nothing, Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state, called it a “small step forward.” But she expressed concern in an interview as early as September that the counting would remain so slow that it would leave room for misinformation about the process to spread.
</p>
<p>
States like hers, Ms. Benson noted, were in dire need of more federal funds for equipment like high-speed envelope openers that could speed the counting.
</p>
<p>
In Washington in the spring, Congress had allocated $400 million for pandemic election preparedness as part of a $2 trillion recovery package known as the CARES Act — a welcome injection, but it was
<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\" title=\"\">
$3.6 billion shy
</a>
of what election officials projected would be needed nationwide.
</p>
<p>
Democrats such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota pushed for more throughout the summer and into the early fall. Several influential Republicans, including Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chairman of the Rules Committee, said they were
<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-open-to-more-election-funding-but-not-on-democrats-terms-11590596514\" title=\"\">
open to providing more
</a>
, but nothing would come of it. Mr. Trump had made clear his opposition to more money to support increased mail-in balloting, and aides to Mr. McConnell argued that Congress had already allocated enough.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, Senator Klobuchar said, she saw the Republican decision to block more money to help run the election and support voting by mail as part of a plan to “create havoc, because that was one of the only paths he saw to victory.”
</p>
<h3>
<span>
‘Incorrect and Not Credible’
</span>
</h3>
<p>
By this fall, Mr. Trump was increasingly likely to have an early advantage on Election Day as the in-person vote came in but to badly lose the mail-in vote and, potentially, the presidency along with it. A digital consulting firm founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, Hawkfish,
<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/bloomberg-group-trump-election-night-scenarios-a554e8f5-9702-437e-ae75-d2be478d42bb.html\" title=\"\">
called
</a>
the early returns the “red mirage.”
</p>
<p>
The president and his allies began a concerted campaign to twist that situation — one to which they contributed by opposing early counting of mail ballots — into something more sinister.

“They are planting stories that President Trump, he’ll have a landslide lead on election night but will lose when they finish counting the mail-in ballots,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1308179513755435009?s=20\" title=\"\">
video posted on Twitter
</a>
in late September that was viewed nearly 2.5 million times. “Their plan is to add millions of fraudulent ballots that can cancel your vote and overturn the election.”
</p>
<p>
The president urged his followers to become poll watchers. “When you go there, watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do,” he said at a rally in North Carolina.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Roman, the Philadelphia operative involved in the New Black Panther Party case, would be in charge of the poll-watching operation. His Twitter account quickly began pumping out
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/technology/trump-ally-tweets-misleading-images-of-philadelphia-voting.html\" title=\"\">
deceptive allegations
</a>
that, for instance, Philadelphia election workers were blocking Trump observers from satellite early voting sites.
</p>
<p>
“What are they hiding?\" he
<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeroman/status/1323605665882013696?s=20\" title=\"\">

<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/01/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-debate-comment-poll-watchers-/\" title=\"\">
In fact
</a>
, Pennsylvania law did not permit observers at the early voting sites.
</p>
<p>
Thousands were hearing the call and the message. On the day before the election, a Republican poll observer in Detroit named Bob Cushman
<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bob.cushman.35/posts/10224756748125708\" title=\"\">
posted a meme on Facebook
</a>
featuring a photoshopped image of Mr. Trump holding a shotgun and the headline “Election stealing will not be tolerated in America.” (As lawyers for the city of Detroit later reported in legal filings, Mr. Cushman shared other posts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.)
</p>
<p>
About 24 hours later, Mr. Trump delivered the same message when he addressed staff members, supporters and followers at the White House while the votes were being tabulated around the country and his early leads were slipping away.
</p>
<p>
“We were winning everything, and all of the sudden it was just called off,” he said. “We want all voting to stop; we don’t want them to find any ballots at four o’clock in the morning and add them to the list.”
</p>
<p>
From there, a fire hose of confusion flooded conservative news media and the major social media platforms.
</p>
<p>
“We believe these people are thieves; we believe the big city machines are corrupt,” the former House Speaker
<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/11/08/gingrich_this_is_a_corrupt_stolen_election_democrats_stole_what_they_had_to_steal.html\" title=\"\">
Newt Gingrich said on Fox &amp; Friends
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
As Democrats, opposing lawyers, fact checkers and in some cases judges pressed for evidence, the Trump campaign released what Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called “234 pages of sworn affidavits” from the Trump poll watchers in Detroit: “real people, real allegation, signed with notaries.’’
</p>
<p>
The affidavits were connected to a last-ditch federal lawsuit by the Trump campaign to prohibit Detroit from certifying its results. But, as lawyers for the city pointed out with expert testimony addressing similar affidavits in another Republican lawsuit in state court, what Republicans described seeing was standard procedure intended to ensure an accurate and legal count.

<p>
For instance, Republicans who believed they had witnessed fraud when workers input birth dates from 1900 for some mail ballots apparently did not understand that this was done in cases where information other than dates of birth were being used for verification and the dates were not readily available. The 1900 date was a place holder for the computer program, which required something in the birth date field.
</p>
<p>
Other witnesses reported that boxes of ballots arrived at the convention center hours after an 8 p.m. deadline; Detroit officials explained that these ballots had arrived on time at other city election offices and boxes and were perfectly legal.
</p>
<p>
On Friday, Judge Timothy M. Kenny dismissed the suit in a Michigan court, largely on the basis that the affidavits were meaningless. The suit’s “interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible,” he found.
</p>
<p>
When thousands of the president’s supporters
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/us/politics/thousands-rally-in-washington-as-clashes-erupt.html\" title=\"\">
demonstrated in Washington

             But the posture of the Republican challengers shifted as the count swung in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and word spread that President Trump would sue. One witness, a nonpartisan observer, Julie Moroney, heard a Republican organizer say, “Now we’re going to challenge every ballot.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Republican volunteers suddenly ramped up their objections across the room: accusations that the workers doing the counting were entering obviously incorrect birth years or backdating ballots. In some cases, the volunteers lodged blanket claims of wrongdoing.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             “What are you doing?” a worker asked a Republican observer who was challenging ballots before he was able to even begin to inspect them, a Democratic observer, Seth Furlow, recalled. The Republican observer responded, “I was told to challenge every one.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Furlow vividly recalled his discomfort with a scene in which mostly white Republican challengers were confronting the mostly Black elections workers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Already, the police had escorted a handful of particularly disruptive observers from the room. But
             <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/11/06/tcf-center-detroit-ballot-counting/6173577002/\" title=\"\">
              tensions increased
             </a>
             when election officials noticed that the number of challengers had grown well beyond what each side was permitted and barred entry in a bid to reduce their ranks. Shouts of “stop the count” went up among Republicans.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fraud that the Republicans claimed to observe was not fraud at all, a Michigan state judge determined on Friday in rejecting a lawsuit filed by allies of Mr. Trump. The various instances of supposed malfeasance were in fact well-established procedures for dealing with the peculiarities of data entry, the correction of minor errors and protocols for social distancing — all intended to ensure a careful and accurate vote count.
            </p>
            <p>
             But in the fact-twisting narrative of Mr. Trump, his political allies and his supporters, the Detroit counting center was a crime scene where Democrats stole an election, a miscarriage demanding that outrage be channeled through the courts, presidential Twitter posts and cable news stemwinders.

             Like similar episodes in Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the scene in Detroit was the culmination of a yearslong strategy by Mr. Trump to use the power of the executive branch, an army of lawyers, the echo chamber of conservative news media and the obedience of fellow Republicans to try out his most audacious exercise in bending reality: to turn losing into winning.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obscured by the postelection noise over the president’s efforts to falsely portray the election system as “rigged” against him has been how much Mr. Trump and his allies did ahead of time to promote a baseless conspiracy devised to appeal to his most passionate supporters, providing him with the opportunity to make his historically anomalous bid to cling to power in the face of defeat.
            </p>
            <p>
             That bid is now in its last throes. Judges are

             </a>
             — with false insinuations of illegitimacy. On Sunday alone, he posted more than two dozen election-related tweets, seeming to briefly acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory before declaring, “

             ”
            </p>
            <p>
             The roots of Mr. Trump’s approach date to before his election in 2016, and he advanced his plans throughout his term. But his strategy for casting doubt on the outcome of the 2020 campaign took shape in earnest when the coronavirus pandemic upended normal life and led states to promote voting by mail.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the start, the president saw mail-in ballots as a political threat that would appeal more to Democrats than to his followers. And so he and his allies sought to block moves to make absentee voting easier and to slow the
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/02/magazine/vote-mail-postal-service.html\" title=\"\">
              counting of mail ballots
             </a>
             . This allowed Mr. Trump to do two things: claim an early victory on election night and paint ballots that were counted later for his opponent as fraudulent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The United States Postal Service, after coming under the leadership of a Trump ally, Louis DeJoy, made several cost-saving moves that severely slowed mail delivery rates and prompted broad
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/us/politics/mail-ballot-usps.html\" title=\"\">
              concern about mail ballots arriving on time
             </a>
             .
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             In the Senate, under the leadership of Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, Republicans blocked Democratic efforts to get more money to states so they could buy more sorting equipment to count the huge influx of mail ballots faster.
            </p>
            <p>
             In key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, Republican-controlled legislatures refused attempts by civil rights groups and Democrats to change or suspend statutes forbidding election workers from beginning to count ballots before Election Day. And once the counting began, the Trump campaign and the president’s allies pursued other tactics to slow or stop the count and seed doubt about the validity of the results.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before Election Day, party officials at the state and national levels helped organize teams of observers, a role that was once a symbol of the transparency of American democracy. But in this case, Mr. Trump and his allies encouraged their observers in key states to act aggressively to stop what they portrayed as widespread cheating and provide information that could be fed into lawsuits and stoke demonstrations and coverage from friendly commentators and journalists.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a Pennsylvania state senator, Mike Regan, a Republican, put it at a

             </a>
             last week, “I’ve been told in no uncertain terms by the state party and by our leaders that they are coordinating with the Trump campaign, and so far Pennsylvania has done everything that the Trump campaign has asked them to do.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Nearly all of it would be done in the name of a falsehood: that the American voting system was so corroded by fraud that any losing result for the president could not be legitimate.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no greater proponent of that notion than Mr. Trump, who promoted it heavily from behind his presidential lectern or from his phone. A presidency that began with a lie — that President Barack Obama was not a citizen — is now ending with one, too.

             Such matching exercises are a necessary part of keeping voting lists accurate. But in recent years, sloppy data comparisons have resulted in erroneous but sensational-sounding claims of supposedly dead or noncitizen voters that repeatedly fell apart after close inspection.

             Before the 2020 election, Republicans in several states pushed aggressive “purges” of their rolls based on such imprecise data matching, often with support from Mr. Trump, before embarrassing revelations that their lists were badly flawed and threatened to wrongfully remove legal voters from their rolls.
            </p>
            <p>
             For instance, a poorly conducted data match led Texas to announce in early 2019 that it had identified some 95,000 “noncitizens” on its registration rolls. The state swiftly moved to strike these supposedly illegal voters — many of them Hispanic — from its lists as Mr. Trump

He signaled how voter fraud allegations would be key to any Trump strategy in 2020, according to a recording that leaked to

             Mr. Clark explained how a ruling from a voter intimidation case against Republicans in New Jersey in the early 1980s had led to a longstanding judicial decree forbidding the Republican National Committee from sending and organizing poll watchers in elections. But that decree finally lapsed in 2018, which,

             The challengers would be focused on Democratic “cheating,” he said. And the Republican Party would have an ability it never had before to blast those charges far and wide, through the social media accounts of the president of the United States.

             “How many times do you have an issue in a county that is just egregious and terrible, but it never gets the attention it deserves, because the media won’t report it?” Mr. Clark told the Republicans. “We’ve got a guy who is committed to this, who is able to short-circuit media attention on stuff and just say things.”

             Wisconsin was one of three key battleground states, along with Pennsylvania and Michigan, where the president had loyal allies who controlled the state legislatures but Democrats were in the governors’ mansions.

            <p>
             During the pandemic, that political dynamic generated clashes that grew more intense as the key role of mail-in balloting became apparent, with Democrats voting by mail in large numbers during primary elections in the spring. The need for more money and new procedures to help process mail ballots more quickly became evident.
            </p>
            <p>
             An explosion of litigation and legislative maneuvering followed, in which voting rights groups and Democrats pressed to make it easier to cast and count mail ballots and Republicans pressed to keep deadlines and restrictions in place, saying they were to prevent fraud.

             A case that reached the Supreme Court gave Wisconsin additional time to count ballots in its primary as the state struggled to conduct the election while the pandemic was raging.
            </p>

             After the Pennsylvania primary in June, Philadelphia officials counted for a week. In the State Legislature, negotiations began over changes that would allow the counting to run more smoothly in November.
            </p>
            <p>
             Local election administrators and Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, sought to allow early processing of mail ballots, known as precanvassing, as early as three weeks before Election Day. Statehouse Republicans publicly signaled a willingness to work on the issue but kept attaching conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             One demand sought to do away with drop boxes, which voters could use for ballots as opposed to the regular mail system; another wanted new signature-matching requirements or to eradicate a provision requiring all poll watchers to live in the county.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Every time we agreed to something that was put out there, they’d raise the bar,” said Jay Costa, the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate who was leading the negotiations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, there seemed to be some momentum behind an agreement that would have allowed for three days of precanvassing, enhanced security measures for drop boxes and ballots postmarked on Election Day and received within three days to be counted. But the deal abruptly fell apart after a Republican caucus meeting in the lower chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Michigan, Republicans in the State Legislature conducted a similar dance, appearing to be willing to provide more time to begin processing ballots, only to negotiate the additional time down to just 10 hours and only in counties with more than 25,000 people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Forced to accept the deal as better than nothing, Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state, called it a “small step forward.” But she expressed concern in an interview as early as September that the counting would remain so slow that it would leave room for misinformation about the process to spread.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             States like hers, Ms. Benson noted, were in dire need of more federal funds for equipment like high-speed envelope openers that could speed the counting.

             In Washington in the spring, Congress had allocated $400 million for pandemic election preparedness as part of a $2 trillion recovery package known as the CARES Act — a welcome injection, but it was

            <p>
             Democrats such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota pushed for more throughout the summer and into the early fall. Several influential Republicans, including Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chairman of the Rules Committee, said they were

              open to providing more
             </a>
             , but nothing would come of it. Mr. Trump had made clear his opposition to more money to support increased mail-in balloting, and aides to Mr. McConnell argued that Congress had already allocated enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             Looking back, Senator Klobuchar said, she saw the Republican decision to block more money to help run the election and support voting by mail as part of a plan to “create havoc, because that was one of the only paths he saw to victory.”

             By this fall, Mr. Trump was increasingly likely to have an early advantage on Election Day as the in-person vote came in but to badly lose the mail-in vote and, potentially, the presidency along with it. A digital consulting firm founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, Hawkfish,

             The president and his allies began a concerted campaign to twist that situation — one to which they contributed by opposing early counting of mail ballots — into something more sinister.

             featuring a photoshopped image of Mr. Trump holding a shotgun and the headline “Election stealing will not be tolerated in America.” (As lawyers for the city of Detroit later reported in legal filings, Mr. Cushman shared other posts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.)

             About 24 hours later, Mr. Trump delivered the same message when he addressed staff members, supporters and followers at the White House while the votes were being tabulated around the country and his early leads were slipping away.

             “We were winning everything, and all of the sudden it was just called off,” he said. “We want all voting to stop; we don’t want them to find any ballots at four o’clock in the morning and add them to the list.”

             As Democrats, opposing lawyers, fact checkers and in some cases judges pressed for evidence, the Trump campaign released what Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called “234 pages of sworn affidavits” from the Trump poll watchers in Detroit: “real people, real allegation, signed with notaries.’’
            </p>
            <p>
             The affidavits were connected to a last-ditch federal lawsuit by the Trump campaign to prohibit Detroit from certifying its results. But, as lawyers for the city pointed out with expert testimony addressing similar affidavits in another Republican lawsuit in state court, what Republicans described seeing was standard procedure intended to ensure an accurate and legal count.

             For instance, Republicans who believed they had witnessed fraud when workers input birth dates from 1900 for some mail ballots apparently did not understand that this was done in cases where information other than dates of birth were being used for verification and the dates were not readily available. The 1900 date was a place holder for the computer program, which required something in the birth date field.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other witnesses reported that boxes of ballots arrived at the convention center hours after an 8 p.m. deadline; Detroit officials explained that these ballots had arrived on time at other city election offices and boxes and were perfectly legal.
