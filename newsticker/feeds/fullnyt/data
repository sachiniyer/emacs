            <p>
             President Trump predicted “bedlam” and a lack of clarity about the presidential results until weeks after Election Day as he barnstormed Pennsylvania, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made his first joint appearance with former President Barack Obama at an event in Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last Saturday before Election Day offered traditional last-minute frantic campaigning in battleground states played against the backdrop of the extraordinary rancor, high stakes and sense of disruption reflecting a pandemic, an economic downturn and recurring protests and unrest at the close of Mr. Trump’s first term.
            </p>
            <p>
             In remarks in Newtown, Pa., and Reading, Pa., Mr. Trump stoked fears of an election left unsettled after voting closes on Nov. 3 and about the prospects that ballots would not count.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You’re going to be waiting for weeks” as votes are counted, Mr. Trump declared in Newtown.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Many, many days,” he went on. “So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision, because Pennsylvania’s very big. We’re going to be waiting. Nov. 3 is going to come and go, and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country.”
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             At his next stop, in Reading, Mr. Trump derided a Supreme Court decision rejecting a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to decide whether the state could continue accepting ballots for three days after Nov. 3.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You see what’s going on, right?” Mr. Trump said of Democrats. “Somebody’s going to play games, and they just got an extension. What’s the extension all about? Wouldn’t you like to hear, Nov. 3, we win, we lose? We win, we lose. Whatever.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The president called the decision “disappointing” and added, “Many, many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. They talk about we control the Supreme — well we don’t control the Supreme Court. That was a terrible decision.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The question of how long ballots can be accepted in battleground states has been a dominant one as Nov. 3 approaches. So has the question of whether Mr. Trump will try to declare victory if he is leading in specific states on Election Day, regardless of whether they have been called in his favor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump barely addressed the coronavirus pandemic at his first two stops, other than to praise his administration, complain about Mr. Biden’s focus on the pandemic and to falsely claim once again that the country was “rounding the turn” as the number of daily new cases nationally has spiked to almost 100,000.
            </p>

            <p>
             Mr. Obama, appearing with Mr. Biden in Flint, Mich., at their first stop of the day, mocked Mr. Trump as heartless.
            </p>

            <p>
             Noting Mr. Trump’s baseless claim a day earlier that doctors were profiting from coronavirus deaths, Mr. Obama said, “He cannot fathom — he does not understand — the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump is continuing to hold crowded rallies as the pandemic rages, and Mr. Obama ridiculed him for his fixation on crowd sizes, asking: “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden spoke next, praising Mr. Obama and ripping Mr. Trump over the pandemic as well. He too invoked Mr. Trump’s baseless statement made at a rally on Friday about doctors and coronavirus-related fatalities.
            </p>
            <p>
             “What in the hell is wrong with this man?” Mr. Biden asked. “Excuse my language, but think about it. It’s perverted. He may believe it because he doesn’t do anything other than for money.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Where both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden campaigned on Saturday was as revealing as what both men said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two states were part of the so-called Blue Wall — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which have leaned Democratic in recent national elections but which were crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 over Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has struggled in all three states throughout the 2020 campaign and is pressing to keep at least one of the three as part of his map this year, in an election cycle marked by a coronavirus pandemic and an economic recession. Pennsylvania is seen by Mr. Trump’s advisers as the likeliest state among the three for him to win.
            </p>

             In Newtown in Bucks County, Mr. Trump delivered a subdued speech, speaking from the teleprompter at first, to several hundred people seated in folding chairs arrayed in a field in front of a stage and a podium.

            <p>
             The speech took place in a field in front of the farmhouse where George Washington planned the crossing of the Delaware River. The small crowd sat close together, mostly unmasked. Unlike it has done at his other rallies, Mr. Trump’s campaign did not position energetic supporters in a stand behind him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president criticized Mr. Biden’s record on trade in a state hit hard in recent years by job losses and after the economic downturn this year caused by the coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump’s teleprompter appeared to have problems at one point, but for the first 45 minutes of his appearance, the president tried to stick to a speech that appeared designed to present him in a more “presidential” light, avoiding some of the angry and defensive outbursts that have been central to his rallies.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then he appeared to lose interest in the speech and began to riff about Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, about his own news coverage and how unfair he thinks the coverage has been of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             He mocked Mr. Biden for wearing sunglasses and dismissed his Democratic rival as merely a puppet of liberal Democrats in Congress.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             And he went on a long, improvised riff about his administration’s production of ventilators as he downplayed concerns about the coronavirus even as the country neared 100,000 new cases a day, with hospitalizations spiking.

             “We have done an incredible job. At some point they are going to recognize that,” Mr. Trump said after mocking Mr. Biden for focusing too much on the virus. “We’ve done an A-plus job. I give ourselves a D, or maybe an F, in terms of public relations.”
            </p>
            <p>
             On Saturday, he said of Mr. Biden’s concerns about the pandemic, “We agree, we agree it’s serious,” but added that his rival’s “only plan is to make you a prisoner in your home, a prisoner in your own country.”.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Reading, Mr. Trump seemed buoyed by a bigger crowd than at his previous stop, as he talked about his own bout of the coronavirus and the fact that the first lady had caught it as well. Joking, he said, “At least those rumors that we don’t live together turned out to be false.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, for the second straight day, Mr. Biden traveled to the Upper Midwest, a critical region where he has multiple ambitions: to win back voters who drifted to Mr. Trump in 2016 and to turn out as many traditional Democratic voters, including Black residents, as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             After making stops in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin on Friday, Mr. Biden devoted Saturday to Michigan. He enlisted a marquee surrogate to help his cause: Mr. Obama, whose presence the campaign hoped would excite voters and help drive turnout in the campaign’s final days.
             
             
            </p>
            <p>
             In the past two weeks, Mr. Obama campaigned solo for Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania and Florida, but Saturday was the first time in the general election that he and Mr. Biden had campaigned together in person. The former president has the potential to help Mr. Biden, who served two terms as his vice president, with key groups like Black voters as well as younger people who might not be naturally drawn to a septuagenarian moderate like Mr. Biden.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           
            <p>
             At a drive-in car rally in Flint, Mr. Obama laid into Mr. Trump over his handling of the pandemic, emphasizing a theme that has been a central message for Mr. Biden in the closing days of the campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, in Detroit, hundreds of people waited in cars to see Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden on Belle Isle, a state park on an island in the middle of the Detroit River with expansive views of the skylines of Detroit and of Windsor, Ontario.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The last four years have been hell,” said Miriam Pizana of Detroit, who came to the rally with her daughter Kristen. “We never knew what the chief of staff or communications directors’ names were before, and now we know them all, and not for anything good.”

                     “Here we are, the worst week, this week! I mean, we’ve been going through this now for months. The federal government has had an opportunity to respond — for months. And his closing argument, this week is that the press and people are too focused on Covid! ‘Covid, Covid, Covid,’ he’s complaining. He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage. And now he’s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic. Think about that. He said this just yesterday. Said doctors are overblowing it because they’re going to make money off it — doctors! He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck. There was just a study by Stanford University that just came out showing thousands of people are likely to have gotten sick because of these rallies he’s holding. What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that? He’s always worried — this is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worrying about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugs him. He talked about, he’s still talking about that. Does he have nothing better to worry about? Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized? What’s with crowds? Well you know, I’ve had crowds before, you know, had quite a few. But, you know, when a country is going through a pandemic, that’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about!”

          FLINT, Mich. — Former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tag-teamed President Trump in their first joint appearance of 2020, with the former president joking that Mr. Trump was “traumatized” by low turnout at his childhood birthday parties and Mr. Biden suggesting he would have bopped Mr. Trump in their younger days.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the final weekend of the campaign, Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama began Saturday with a drive-in rally in Flint in a bid to maximize turnout. Later, they held another drive-in rally in Detroit, where Stevie Wonder performed. The Biden campaign also announced that Mr. Obama would campaign in Atlanta and South Florida on Monday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Obama won Michigan twice, and Genesee County, home to Flint, is an example of a place where Democrats lost significant ground in 2016 compared with how the Obama-Biden ticket had fared.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Flint, the former president began by praising Mr. Biden for his decency, then pivoted to offense, the task
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/us/politics/obama-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           he has pursued with vigor
          </a>
          in appearances over the past two weeks. He laced into his successor for

           suggesting on Friday
          </a>
          that physicians are magnifying the severity of the pandemic to make money.
         </p>
         <p>
          “He cannot fathom — he does not understand — the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck,” Mr. Obama said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The former president also took aim at Mr. Trump’s fixation on the size of the crowds that turn out for him. “What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size?” he asked. “Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?”
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Trump for his reported comments about America’s war dead and noted that Mr. Trump “likes to portray himself as a tough guy.” Then he suggested he would have wanted to punch Mr. Trump back in the day. “When you were in high school, wouldn’t you have liked to take the shot?” Mr. Biden said. “Anyway, that’s a different story, but anyway. A macho man.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Later, in Detroit, Mr. Biden mocked Mr. Trump for having written off as business expenses
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/business/trump-taxes-hair.html\" title=\"\">
           more than $70,000 paid to style his hair
          </a>
          during “The Apprentice.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I tell you what, man,” Mr. Biden said. “I hardly have any hair, but I’d rather have what I have.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Their visit to Michigan also included a clutch shot by Mr. Obama, who drained a 3-pointer in a school gym in Flint and then walked off the court. “That’s what I do,” he said.

                     “And I think we will win Minnesota. We’re very close last time. And we should win it, when they let Minneapolis burn, we should win it. But I think we’re going to win it. And again, 1972 was the last time. Can you believe that? I think we’re going to do it. We’ll find out. You’re going to know it about — Well I hope, based on the Supreme Court, they don’t delay it too long, this decision yesterday, I will tell you was not a good decision. You’re allowed to wait days to count and days to have the final count. You’re allowed to have time limits beyond Nov. 3. So what does this mean? The whole world, and our nation, is going to be waiting and waiting and waiting to hear who won. They’re going to — You’re going to be waiting. You’re going to be waiting for weeks and a very dangerous thing happens Nov. 3 and now you have to wait and wait. And very bad things can happen with ballots during that period of Nov. 3 to whatever date they gave them. Many many days. So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania is very big. And as you know, there was another state. But perhaps other states as well. This is a terrible thing that they’ve done to our country. And that’s the United States Supreme Court I’m talking about. That is a terrible, political, horrible, decision that they made. We’re going to be waiting Nov. 3 is going to come and go. And we’re not going to know and you’re going to have bedlam in our country.” ”This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country. And I say it, and I say it loud, and I say it proud.” “Just three days from now and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you’re there. And sure as we’re here together that wave is forming and they see it. They see it on all sides and there’s not a thing they can do about it.”

          President Trump predicted on Saturday that the presidential election would not be decided on Tuesday, warning that “you’re going to be waiting for weeks” and suggesting — with no evidence — that “very bad things” could happen while states are counting ballots in the days after Election Day.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s comments came as he kicked off four Saturday campaign stops in Pennsylvania with a subdued speech to several hundred people, boasting about his accomplishments and attacking his rival while he predicted victory next week.
         </p>
         <p>
          “So you’re going to be watching on Nov. 3. I think it’s highly likely you’re not going to have a decision because Pennsylvania’s very big,” Mr. Trump said at his first stop in Newtown. “We’re going to be waiting, Nov. 3 is going to come and go, and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s campaign has aggressively sought to prevent Pennsylvania and other states from extending the time they are allowed to count mail-in ballots, which have been used in greater numbers than ever before because of concerns about in-person voting during the pandemic. On Friday, the
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/supreme-court-pennsylvania-north-carolina-absentee-ballots.html\" title=\"\">
           Supreme Court ruled that Pennsylvania officials can accept absentee ballots for three days
          </a>
          after Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And I say it, and I say it loud and I say it proud.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Despite his concerns about ballots, Mr. Trump predicted that Republicans would win the presidency and do well in congressional elections, waving aside polls which suggest that Democrats are leading in battleground states across the country.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president’s first speech took place in a field in front of the farmhouse where George Washington planned the crossing of the Delaware River. The small crowd sat close together, mostly unmasked. Mr. Trump did not have his typical backdrop of energetic supporters standing behind him.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was more animated in his second rally of the day, in Reading, where he spoke before a boisterous crowd of several thousand supporters. The president called his rivals names, lashed out at the news media, made false assertions about his record and suggested again that the election would not be decided on Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          He played video clips on a large screen showing his rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., making verbal gaffes, with Sean Hannity, a Fox News host, calling him a “clear and present danger to this country.” The president also played a Halloween-themed television ad on the screen showing an adult trick-or-treater approaching a home wearing a Biden mask.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Know who you’re voting for. Don’t get tricked,” the person said, taking off the mask to reveal the face of Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Trump has two more rallies in Pennsylvania as he races to try to catch up to Mr. Biden, his Democratic rival, who has consistently led in polls in the crucial swing state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Newtown, Mr. Trump’s teleprompter appeared to have problems at one point, but for the most part he tried to stick to a speech that appeared designed to present him in a more “presidential” light, avoiding some of the angry and defensive rants that have been central to his rallies.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Reading, Mr. Trump seemed impressed by the size of his crowd, suggesting that the passion among his supporters would save the day for his re-election campaign.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This doesn’t seem like someone who is going to come in second, do you?” Mr. Trump asked. “I don’t think so.”

          Police officers and sheriff’s deputies in Graham, N.C., deployed a chemical spray and arrested eight people at a march and rally on Saturday that were intended to honor George Floyd and encourage people to vote, according to the police and participants.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I am truly disturbed by the fact that people who are charged to protect and to serve” sprayed a chemical agent on marchers who were taking people to the polls, said the Rev. Gregory B. Drumwright, an organizer of
          <a href=\"https://www.thetimesnews.com/story/news/2020/10/14/activist-announces-i-am-change-march-wednesday-press-conference/3658546001/\" title=\"\">

          , who was among those arrested.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We never got to the polls because the sheriff’s office worked overtime to find a way to quell our efforts and suppress our voices,” he said in an interview.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Graham police said in a statement that officers had deployed a “pepper-based vapor” after the marchers blocked traffic in the street, “causing a traffic and safety hazard.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Eventually, the march moved on to a courthouse for a speaking program, where the police also intervened. Officers once again sprayed a “pepper-based vapor onto the ground to assist in dispersing the crowd,” the police said, adding that several people had ignored commands to leave.
         </p>
         <p>
          The people arrested were charged with offenses including failing to disperse and one count of assault on a law enforcement officer, the police said.

          Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is up for re-election on Tuesday,
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NC_Governor/status/1322697365636239361\" title=\"\">
           said on Twitter
          </a>
          that the confrontation was “unacceptable.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “Peaceful demonstrators should be able to have their voices heard and voter intimidation in any form cannot be tolerated,” Mr. Cooper wrote.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mayor Ian Baltutis of nearby Burlington, N.C., who marched and spoke at the event, said it had drawn a multiracial crowd of about 150 to 200 people in Graham, a city of about 15,000 located 50 miles northwest of Raleigh.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Baltutis said that after a sheriff’s deputy ordered the crowd to disperse within five minutes, deputies used the spray and tried to push people across the street.
         </p>
         <p>
          “As an elected leader, it’s not an example of the professional policing and de-escalation we would expect,” Mr. Baltutis said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Alamance County Sheriff’s Office, which also used the spray, according to participants, did not respond to requests for comment.

          AUSTIN, Texas — Multiple vehicles bearing Trump flags and signs surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus heading from San Antonio to Austin on Friday, forcing campaign officials to scrap two campaign events, according to
          
          
          reports by Democratic officials on Saturday.
         </p>
         <p>
          The vehicles surrounded the bus on busy Interstate 35 and appeared to be attempting to slow it down and force it to the side of the road, according to social media posts from witnesses and accounts by party activists. In one instance, the vehicles pulled in front of the bus and tried to stop in the middle of the highway.
         </p>
         <p>
          Katie Naranjo, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, tweeted that Trump supporters also “ran into a person’s car, yelling curse words and threats.” The bus was occupied by campaign staff workers, who notified local law enforcement, which assisted the vehicle in reaching its destination, party officials said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Out of “an abundance of caution,” they said, the campaign canceled an event scheduled for later that day at a parking lot belonging to the Texas A.F.L.-C.I.O. in downtown Austin. A campaign event in suburban Pflugerville was also scrapped.
         </p>
         
          
         <p>
          “Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way,” Tariq Thowfeek, the Texas communications director for the Biden for President campaign, said in a statement.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Our supporters will continue to organize their communities for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot,” Mr. Thowfeek said, “and to the Texans who disrupted our events: We’ll see you on November 3rd.

          More than 90 million votes have already been cast in the 2020 presidential election — about 65 percent of the total turnout in 2016, according to data updated Saturday afternoon by the
          <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html\" title=\"\">
           U.S. Elections Project
          </a>
          , an effort led by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number of early votes cast has already shattered the previous early turnout record set in 2016, thanks in large part to expansions of mail and absentee voting put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 91 million ballots have been sent to voters through the mail, and as of Saturday, 57 million of them have been returned. Over 32 million votes have been cast early and in person, according to the Elections Project.

           A New York Times analysis
          </a>
          of polling and ballot-request data shows that more Democrats have requested absentee ballots than Republicans have, and that most Republicans are likely to vote in person on Election Day. Experts have warned against drawing conclusions about the outcome of the race from early vote data for that reason and others. (Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s apparent edge in the early vote was
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/early-voting-registration.html\" title=\"\">
           widely reported
          </a>
          in 2016 in the days before she ultimately lost the Electoral College.)
         </p>
         <p>
          Still, experts have acknowledged that the early vote data so far does suggest turnout may exceed the 139 million votes cast in 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
          The early vote is being watched particularly closely in crucial swing states like Florida, a state the president narrowly carried against Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and where
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/politics/who-will-win-florida-polls.html\" title=\"\">
           polling is showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. slightly ahead

          . Data from the Elections Project shows that about 8.3 million ballots have been cast in Florida, a total representing roughly 59 percent of the registered voters in the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Texas, more than 9.6 million ballots had been cast as of Friday,

           more than the roughly 8.9 million Texans who voted statewide four years ago

          PITTSBURGH — In 2016, Allegheny County, which includes the city of Pittsburgh, voted for Hillary Clinton by a 16-point margin. At the same time, it gave Donald Trump more votes than he received in any other county in the state.
         </p>

          The battle over these margins is a matter of suburban geography, as a solidly blue city pushes further out against an ever-reddening western Pennsylvania, a shoving match that will go far in determining the winner of the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the front lines of that Democratic push is an army of “resistance” groups formed immediately after the 2016 election, mostly consisting of midcareer women who were electrified by Mr. Trump’s election. Marie Norman, 55, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, is one of them: Her group, called the Order of the Phoenix, has been churning out postcards and deploying door-to-door canvassers since forming nearly four years ago.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Saturday morning, Professor Norman was canvassing in the suburbs south of the city for statehouse candidates, including a state senator trying to hold a seat in hotly contested territory on the frontiers of the Democrats’ post-2016 suburban advance. “I feel a lot of energy this time canvassing — different from 2018,” she said. “I’m sure there’s more energy for Trump, too.”
         </p>
         <p>
          A few minutes later, an S.U.V. driving down the quiet street proved her point: It was covered with Trump decals and flying Trump flags.
         </p>
         <p>
          Along three suburban blocks, Professor Norman met Biden voters who were fervently hoping that he wins and others who were somewhat skeptical of him; a Trump voter who ripped up Professor Norman’s fliers at the door; and another who had a friendly discussion about not wanting to brainwash his children with his own political opinions. That she would be meeting all of these people while campaigning for a state house candidate would have been unthinkable before the 2016 election.
         </p>
         <p>
          Professor Norman said she felt confident in a Biden victory in the county in terms of votes already cast — the Democrats currently hold a nearly 4-1 advantage in returned mail-in and absentee ballots — but she worried about whether the ballots would all be counted. A Trump win will be hard to recover from, she said, but win or lose, she plans to keep the Order of the Phoenix going, with a future focus on judicial elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The 2016 election, she said, “totally changed my life.”

          MIAMI — The biggest pool of votes in Florida is in Miami-Dade County, where turnout has been lagging among Black and Hispanic voters, both key demographics for Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Senator Kamala Harris spent Saturday in South Florida, trying to shore up votes in the final weekend of early voting, which has traditionally been when Democrats here close the gap with Republicans.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Everybody needs to vote,” Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told reporters in Palm Beach County. “We’re here to say, ‘Listen, everything is at stake.’”
         </p>
         <p>
          Democrats have plenty of work to do: Black voters and Puerto Rican voters, who tend to lean Democratic, have been casting ballots at a lower rate than the rest of the electorate in Miami-Dade, according to an analysis by Hawkfish, a Democratic technology and data firm.
         </p>
         <p>
          About 50 percent of Black voters and 45 percent of Puerto Rican voters have voted, compared to 58 percent of other Hispanic voters, 61 percent of white voters and 62 percent of
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/us/miami-cuban-trump-biden.html\" title=\"\">
           Cuban-American voters
          </a>
          , who tend to lean conservative.
         </p>
         <p>
          Miami-Dade has about 1.5 million registered voters. Hillary Clinton won the county by some 300,000 votes, a margin that Joseph R. Biden Jr. is not expected to match — and that was not enough to win Mrs. Clinton the state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Voters of Cuban, Colombian, Nicaraguan and

          </a>
          descent have appeared particularly receptive to the Republican narrative that Mr. Biden, who has a long record as a centrist, and Ms. Harris are socialists. At her first event of the day in Miami, Ms. Harris flicked at that concern.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Joe and I are proud, patriotic Americans,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          But the message has stuck.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re not leftists, as Cubans,” said Gloria Davis, a 59-year-old Republican, after voting for President Trump on Saturday at the library in Westchester, a conservative stronghold that as of Friday had the most early votes cast in the county. “I see the leftists in the Democratic Party.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Republicans kept hammering away at the line outside the Coral Gables Library, another voting site. Under the blazing sun, Senator Marco Rubio, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and other local Republicans denounced Democrats as closet socialists.
         </p>
         <p>
          “In Washington, they vote just like
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html\" title=\"\">
           Bernie Sanders
          </a>
          ,” Mr. Rubio said in Spanish as salsa music blared in the background.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden’s troubles with Black voters came up on Friday in a phone call between the campaign and local Democratic members of Congress ahead of Ms. Harris’s visit. Representative Frederica Wilson of Miami Gardens, who is African-American, raised concerns about the campaign’s ground game, according to a person briefed on the call. Ms. Wilson appeared with Ms. Harris at an event on Saturday, and the Biden team has planned a slew of Souls to the Polls events targeting Black voters on Sunday.
         </p>
         <p>
          One encouraging sign for Democrats has been increased turnout in Broward County, the most Democratic in the state, where Caribbean-American voters have been enthusiastic about Ms. Harris, whose father is Jamaican.
         </p>
         <p>
          “When we talk about African-American and Caribbean voters in Florida, they want to know they have a president who understands the commonality between all of us,” Ms. Harris said. “They want a president who speaks to our higher purposes and our better angels, as opposed to speaking to hate and division.”

          ROSWELL, Ga. — On Saturday afternoon, Senator Kelly Loeffler held a rally in the northern Atlanta suburbs, an affluent area that used to be a Republican safe space until Donald Trump
          <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/trump-wins-georgia-but-turns-some-atlanta-suburbs-blue/8HY6eDcPhoxEK5TiUcPeXJ/\" title=\"\">
           lost it
          </a>
          in 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
          If some voters in these suburbs have determined that the Republican Party has gone too far to the right — or fear that Trumpism has twisted the party — Ms. Loeffler had not come to change those kinds of minds.
         </p>
         <p>
          Standing on the back of a pickup in the parking lot of a mid-rise office building, Ms. Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat 10 months ago by Gov. Brian Kemp, bragged about her support for the president. She warned of the rise of socialism, the “fake news” and “the deep state” (“It’s all real,” she said). She gave a warm-up speaking spot to Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican congressional candidate best known for her embrace of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Loeffler also indicated that she had no plans to move to the center. And that could serve as a preview of the tenor of the complicated special-election contest for her seat, one that could help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Nov. 3 ballot is a crowded one, and if no candidate gets a majority of votes, the race will go to a January runoff. Leading in

          , the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Ms. Loeffler has been mostly duking it out with a rival Republican, Representative Doug Collins.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two Republicans have been engaged in a virtual primary of sorts, throwing mud and striving to out-conservative each other. And while some Republicans thought Ms. Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, might take a moderate path to win over suburban women, she instead tacked hard right as a campaigner,
          <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/15/kelly-loeffler-marjorie-taylor-greene-endorsement-429635\" title=\"\">
           enthusiastically accepting
          </a>
          the endorsement of Ms. Greene.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Roswell, before an outdoor crowd of about 100 people, Ms. Loeffler issued an awkwardly phrased sentence or two whose message was nonetheless clear: This is who she is. And she is not changing.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve had people give me feedback and say, you know, maybe you’re, you know, maybe you’d do more, get in the middle, whatever,” she said. “I am who I am because of my values.”

         <p>
          PHILADELPHIA — Add Debra Messing and Kathy Najimy to the thousands of canvassers spread out across Philadelphia for the Biden campaign on Saturday.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two actors went knocking door to door with Sharif Street, a state senator, as the Biden campaign’s turnout operation kicked into high gear in this epicenter of Democratic support in the critical battleground state.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Everything is on Pennsylvania, this is it,” said Ms. Messing as she rallied a group of canvassers on the corner of North Carlisle Street and West Susquehanna Avenue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Throughout the city, the Biden campaign has been deploying volunteers to the doors of likely Democratic voters who either have not returned their absentee ballot or never requested one. Nearly two million registered Democrats requested absentee ballots, compared with fewer than 790,000 Republicans.
         </p>
         
          
         <p>
          The message on Saturday from the canvassers was to make sure voters know how to navigate either the absentee ballot drop-off process, or voting on Election Day, with the focus on making a “plan to vote.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’m going to vote, and vote for Biden,” said Kevin Robinson, 66. Ms. Messing let out a whoop and told Mr. Robinson, who was favoring his left knee, that if he was physically unable to stand in line, he could move ahead in the line. “I’ll need that,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Messing and Ms. Najimy, who have long been politically active, said that even after having volunteered in previous elections, this one felt different and more urgent.
         </p>
         <p>
          “There is a feeling of unrest that I’ve never experienced before,” Ms. Najimy said. “It’s like Donald Trump has taken a hammer to whatever unity we had and smashed it.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, having celebrity canvassers can help a door-knocking operation’s success. While most canvassers are lucky to see half of the doors they knock crack open, nearly every resident came out to see Ms. Messing and Ms. Najimy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Vendetta Sample, 56, saw the two women and ran down her stoop to greet them. “I voted, I voted early,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Did you vote for —” Ms. Messing started to ask before she was cut off.
         </p>
         <p>
          “You dang know I did,” Ms. Sample said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Biden campaign app also had a man named Sean on its list who lived at Ms. Sample’s address. Ms. Messing asked about Sean and if he voted.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Sean’s not here, he’s working,” said Ms. Sample. “I don’t know if he voted.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “You’re going to call Sean and you’re going to say we came to see him, and you’re going to say you promised us that you would kick his ass if he doesn’t vote.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Sample smiled, pantomiming a kick, when her young grandson, wearing a Spider-Man mask, poked his head out.
         </p>
         <p>
          “What you say about my daddy?” he asked. “Say that again and I’ll punch you in your face.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The entire canvassing team laughed.
         </p>
         <p>
          “That’s Philly,” one said.

          SUN CITY, Ariz. — Don’t believe the polls. Don’t believe the media. And definitely do not believe the Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was the message from Republican leaders to the party’s foot soldiers gathering Saturday in Sun City. The volunteers were getting ready to fan out in this retirement community in Maricopa County, where Donald Trump won in 2016 with 49 percent of the vote, to rally voters for Mr. Trump and Martha McSally, the Republican senator whom polls have consistently shown running behind her Democratic challenger.
         </p>
         <p>
          “You all know why this is the most consequential election in our life,” Ms. McSally told the crowd inside the local Republican headquarters, flanked by cardboard cutouts of Mr. Trump and former President Ronald Reagan. “They’re coming after our county. They’re coming after our state.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Still, Ms. McSally tried to strike a cheerful tone.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re on the verge of a great American comeback,” she said to a round of cheers.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was little need to convince the crowd, who appeared to be optimistic about the party’s chances.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve never seen energy like we’re seeing now,” said Patti Thompson, a 72-year-old party activist who wore a Women for Trump T-shirt emblazoned with an image of a stars-and-stripes stiletto. “People care about saving our country. You can’t let the liberals take — we cannot let them run our country.”

          MILWAUKEE — Mary Beth Mathes brought her ballot to a drop box outside a public library on Milwaukee’s South Side Saturday, but she was missing one thing: the witness signature required by Wisconsin state law.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Ms. Mathes, a flight attendant for United Airlines, went inside the library to find Carol Dohm, the supervisor for the city’s early voting site at the library.
         </p>
         <p>
          On top of the drop box, Ms. Dohm signed Ms. Mathes’s ballot, then Ms. Mathes signed it too. Then both women engaged in a brief celebration, shimmying, throwing their arms in the air and yelling “yeaaaaah!”
         </p>
         <p>
          “I was just so excited to vote,” said Ms. Mathes, 50, who voted for President Trump. “I’m going to be back in town on Election Day, but I didn’t want to deal with the long lines.”
         </p>
         <p>
          While Milwaukee is heavily Democratic, its South Side, filled with a mix of Hispanic and older white voters, is the most Republican part of the city.
         </p>
         <p>
          A slow procession of voters came to the Tippecanoe branch of the Milwaukee Public Library Saturday. Just five voters at a time were allowed inside the area within the library set aside for voting, where two machines were in use. Officials on site said the foot traffic had been much busier during the week, and the line had moved slowly last weekend, too.
         </p>
         <p>
          Milwaukee is one of just a few Wisconsin municipalities with in-person early voting this weekend. State law allows in-person early voting from Oct. 20 through Sunday, though most communities held their last early voting day on Friday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Voters who have received an absentee ballot but have yet to return it have until the polls close Tuesday night to either deposit the ballots in a drop box or hand deliver them to a municipal clerk or a polling place.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Mathes’s experience demonstrates one last hurdle to absentee voting that Wisconsin Republicans put in place when they enacted a series of electoral reforms in the last decade — finding a witness signature, which can be difficult for people who live alone during the pandemic, which is raging across Wisconsin.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Mathes said she voted for Mr. Trump because of his economic record and his stance opposing abortion rights. In a second term, she said, she hopes he would end many of the pandemic-related restrictions that have been put in place.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t know if we can resolve it,” she said of the virus. “Hopefully we can open things up again and keep people working.”

            Ohio could be decided by women in the hotly contested suburbs.

         <p>
          COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016, but multiple polls have painted a troubling new picture for Mr. Trump in a state that no Republican has ever won a presidential race without.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Ohio, as in much else of the nation, Mr. Trump has bled support from suburban voters. And so with Mr. Biden’s hold on Ohio’s metro centers, and Mr. Trump’s commanding lead in its rural areas, the tossup state could come down to voters like Amy W., a white college-educated Republican from Westerville, a suburb northeast of Columbus.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Saturday afternoon, she stood in line at her Franklin County polling station, located in a shopping center. The line ran through much of the parking lot but moved swiftly. Amy, 55, would only whisper that she planned to vote for Mr. Biden and declined to give her last name because she was afraid, she said, of Mr. Trump’s supporters.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was also why she was voting early: “When Trump said he was going to have people out watching, that scared the heck out of me,” she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amy, a payroll coordinator, said she was voting for Mr. Biden in honor of her mother, who died earlier this year in a nursing home after contracting the coronavirus. She blamed Mr. Trump for downplaying the threat of the virus.
         </p>
         <p>
          “She was alone, and I couldn’t be with her,” she said of her mother, and began crying softly. “I feel like I let her down.”

          In the final days of an historic campaign season, Democrats in Georgia are searching for people like Linda Wingfield.
         </p>
         <p>
          On Friday, Ms. Wingfield left her shift as a fast-food cook and cast a ballot for the very first time — at 59 years old.
         </p>
         <p>
          “It means a lot to me,” Ms. Wingfield said as she lined up along with about 15 other Black voters outside the Adams Park Library in Atlanta.
         </p>
         <p>
          After decades of staying away from the polls, Ms. Wingfield was spurred to vote by a strong dislike for President Trump.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We need somebody to help us, not destroy us,” she said, calling on “God’s faith” to elect Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
         </p>
         <p>
          Friday was the final day for early, in-person voting in Georgia. And as the numbers were posted on Saturday, some experts saw worrying signs in the numbers for Democrats.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of the nearly 2.7 million people who cast their ballots in early, in-person voting, only 709,000, or 26.4 percent, were identified as Black.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number does not include absentee ballots, and thousands of those have not been received.
         </p>
         <p>
          Even so, Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia in Athens, said the percentage of Black voters was in line with the numbers in the state during Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential race in 2016. “I believe Democrats would be concerned about the Black turnout where it is,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hoping to make sure the scales tip in their favor, Democrats are mounting a last-minute push, urging not only their loyal supporters to vote, but also reaching out to the apathetic and even chronic nonvoters, such as Ms. Wingfield.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t have to tell you the stakes,” Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate running against the incumbent, Senator David Perdue, said during in a Zoom call on Saturday with college students running a get-out-the-vote phone bank.
         </p>
         <p>
          He also announced that former President Barack Obama would be coming to Atlanta on Monday in an effort to “turn out voters and get everybody out to the polls on Election Day.”
         </p>
         <p>
          And on Saturday, Raphael G. Warnock, the pastor who is running against Senator Kelly Loeffler, was holding get-out-the-vote rallies with Democrats in DeKalb County and with South Asian voters in Suwanee, Ga.

          PHILADELPHIA — The corner of Limekiln Pike and East Pastorius Street was bustling with
          <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/1322574073608720386\" title=\"\">
           people bundled for a chilly day
          </a>
          of door-to-door canvassing here in northwest Philadelphia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Wearing masks with the word “vote” on them and clutching signs reading “African Americans for Biden,” they fanned out across this predominantly Black neighborhood, knocking on the doors of likely Democratic voters who had not yet returned their absentee ballots, or who hadn’t requested one at all.
         </p>
         <p>
          The city, which is the beating heart of Democratic support in this crucial battleground state, has been returning absentee ballots at a relatively high rate, with 74 percent returned as of Saturday, according to data from the U.S. Elections Project, an effort led by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          But Philadelphia, where 38 percent of registered voters requested absentee ballots, did not embrace the method as strongly as Allegheny County — home to Pittsburgh and
          
          
          the other major Democratic county in the state — where 44 percent of registered voters requested absentee ballots.
         </p>
         <p>
          Part of that is because the Democratic Party in Philadelphia
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/politics/democrats-in-person-voting.html\" title=\"\">
           began telling voters this month
          </a>
          that they should instead focus on in-person voting, and part of that is because the city has a strong Election Day voting tradition, which was evident on Saturday as canvassers knocked on numerous doors and were greeted with supportive fist pumps and pledges to vote early on Election Day.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ll be there,” said Edward Tomlin, 70, as he leaned out of his door to greet a Biden canvasser.
         </p>
         <p>
          His neighbors, members of the Griffin family, are all planning to vote in person on Election Day, including one person who will be voting for the first time.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Mr. Tomlin was told that there might be a line and he might want to bring a chair, he waved it off.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ll be fine,” he said.

          In the homestretch of the presidential election, the Biden campaign has dominated the paid media landscape.
         </p>
         <p>
          On television and radio, the Biden campaign spent $66.2 million over the past week — from Oct. 23 to Oct. 30 — while the Trump campaign spent only about $19.4 million, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. The Republican National Committee has helped to pick up some of some of the Trump campaign’s slack and has run about $16 million worth of ads during the same period.
         </p>
         <p>
          The spending advantage for Democrats holds on Facebook, where the Biden campaign has spent roughly $9 million over the past week, and the Trump campaign has spent $4.4 million during the same stretch on the platform.
         </p>
         <p>
          The yawning spending gap between the two campaigns with just 72 hours to go until Election Day has persisted during the final weeks of the presidential race, as the Biden campaign has enjoyed an influx of donations at a time the Trump campaign has experienced a cash crunch.
         </p>
         <p>
          President Trump had at one point raised more than
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html\" title=\"\">

          for his re-election and had a fund-raising head start on Democrats. But

           that financial advantage has disappeared
          </a>
          , and Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered October with roughly triple the funds at his disposal as Mr. Trump: $177 million to $63.1 million. The Biden campaign has leveraged that cash advantage on the airwaves, going up with ads as Mr. Trump’s team has slashed its ad spending budget.

                    Trump’s Campaign Is Building an Army of Poll Watchers. What Can They Actually Do?

                    President Trump and his campaign have been calling for an army of poll watchers on Election Day. What is poll watching, and when does it cross the line? We look at how a federal consent decree restricted the Republican Party for decades, and why its expiration could make a difference in 2020.

                     This year, as the president has been talking about— “Fraud like you’ve never seen. They have these fake ballots. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll watchers.” “His language has taken on an almost militaristic tone.” “Go into the polls and watch very carefully. Be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.” There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections. Still, the president talks about recruiting an army of poll watchers. “It’s taken on such an aggressive nature in a way that we’ve kind of never seen before. It’s very frightening to election officials.” “It paints poll watching with a veneer of antagonism, combat and not in the spirit of protecting our elections.” But it’s more than just rhetoric. This year, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll watching operations in ways we haven’t seen for nearly 40 years. To understand why, let’s take a trip back in time — “Wherever I go, people ask me what a New Jersey vacation is like” — to a governor’s race in New Jersey in 1981. “When I ran in that election, it was a very interesting election, to say the least.” This was the Democratic candidate James Florio. And here he is now. “That’s a long time ago, that’s 40 years ago.” The race was an early referendum on the Reagan administration. “I like Tom Kean.” “Kean has endorsed Reaganomics and proposed cuts in state taxes on business. The Democratic candidate, Congressman James Florio, attacks both Reagan’s and Kean’s economic plan.” “We thought it would be an election on the merits of the issues” — “revitalizing our railroads, cleaning up toxic waste, strengthening law enforcement” — “turned out that was not all involving the merits.” It was the closest fought election in the history of the state. But as it turns out, it wasn’t a clean fight. “Election day yielded some surprises to a lot of people who went to the polls because people saw off duty policemen with armbands that said ‘members of the Ballot Security Task Force.’” “That’s the Republican group, which according to state Democrats, intimidated some minority voters.” “It looked very official. And they were standing there with their guns.” “They obstructed voters from casting ballots. But also they obstructed access by poll workers.” More than 200 task force members showed up at the polls, confronting voters in Democratic strongholds. They were in Newark but not in Short Hills. They were in Trenton but not Princeton. And Camden but not in Cherry Hill. “If you look at the demographics of the neighborhoods that were targeted for these efforts, they were all predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods. White voters were not targeted in the same way at all.” “So it was clear that they’re not concerned about ballot integrity. They’re concerned about intimidation. It was a very clever, sinister initiative.” In the end, Florio lost by a razor thin margin. “1,797 votes out of 2.3 million votes. The intimidation had an impact on the outcome of the election.” “It’s a case of sour grapes from Democrats that don’t know how to take defeat.” But this wasn’t just a local effort. Investigations suggested that the task force was organized and paid for by the Republican National Committee. “A covert operation that was at the very least intentionally misleading and resulted in technical violations of our election laws.” Democrats sued the R.N.C. for violating the Voting Rights Act. The R.N.C. was forced to enter into a federal consent decree that would restrict them for years to come. “For the better part of the past four decades, the Republican National Party has been under a consent decree that has limited their ability to coordinate some of these poll watching activities.” “So it created a mechanism that deterred any additional voter intimidation and also created a check on future R.N.C. efforts that might target minority communities.” Under the terms of the consent decree, the R.N.C. had to get court approval for poll watching plans. The party tried unsuccessfully to get out of it for many years. “And they were found to be in violation of the consent decree at least three times since it was put into place.” Then in 2017, the court allowed the consent decree to expire, setting up a different kind of fight in 2020. “This will be the first presidential election where we will see the Republican National Party operating a poll watching operation without the consent decree hovering over their heads. Now that it has been lifted, it looks like there is going to be a more organized and a bigger poll watching operation coming out of the Republican National Party.” Republicans say they’re training more than 50,000 poll watchers in at least 15 battleground states. They’ve released a series of carefully worded training presentations for volunteers. “Poll watchers are the first line of defense for President Trump. Be courteous to county staff and other watchers. Yes, even our Democrat friends. Do not speak with voters and do not interfere with the orderly conduct of the voting process.” Their presence at the polls is perfectly legal if they follow the rules. In early voting this year, there have been a few potential violations. Pennsylvania’s attorney general called out illegal surveillance of a ballot dropbox in Philadelphia. And local news in Florida reported on two armed private security guards who posted themselves near an early voting site. “Two armed security guards showed up outside of the downtown St. Pete early voting location.” “Pretty much ever since the president has been calling on his supporters to watch the polls, election officials and law enforcement agencies across the country have kind of been preparing for what may be an influx of people who don’t know the rules and regulations of poll watching.” In a statement, the R.N.C. said its poll watchers have received rigorous training to follow state laws and are not there to be intimidating. “The big unknown is exactly how big and how widespread the deployment of these poll watchers will be and whether they will have any kind of marching orders from the Republican Party or the Trump campaign to really question a bunch of voters’ eligibility or whether they’ll just kind of follow the more traditional ways.” Ultimately, the consent decree offered a legal shortcut to stop the R.N.C.’s poll watching operations if they crossed the line. “What’s important to keep in mind is that the tactics that were unlawful in 1980 are just as unlawful in 2020. There has never been permission for any political party or any private party to engage in racially targeted voter intimidation or voter intimidation of any sort. And so we’re not without protection. We’re not without tools to combat it. But we do have one less in our arsenal.” “If we see a resumption of the same type of thing this time, we’ll have to go back to court. I can be authoritatively the person that can be definitive and say that small margins make a big difference.”

          President Trump and his campaign have been calling for an army of poll watchers on Election Day. And with the expiration of a decades-old court order, the Republican Party can throw its full weight behind the president’s poll-watching operations nationwide.
         </p>
         <p>
          The R.N.C. says its poll watchers are carefully trained, but the campaign’s rhetoric has raised fears of voter intimidation, like the kind that lead to the original court order. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee paid and organized armed, off-duty police officers to patrol polling stations in minority neighborhoods in New Jersey. Democrats sued, and got the R.N.C. to enter into a consent decree in 1982, restricting the party’s poll watching efforts for 35 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          It expired in 2017, making 2020 the first presidential election without this extra layer of protection. Voter intimidation remains illegal, but without the consent decree the main challenge is litigation, which could take years.

             The presidential race in Florida looks similar to 2016 in at least one regard: It’ll probably be close, maybe decided again by just
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\" title=\"\">
              a single percentage point
             </a>
             . But under the surface, there will be major differences in terms of who’s voting for whom.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump can count on the continued support of rural voters and white men, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. is almost guaranteed to carry strong support from women and African-American voters across the state.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Yet Mr. Biden is unlikely to hold on to Hillary Clinton’s strong showing with Latino voters. Instead, he’s looking to make up for it among some of the white voting blocs that Mr. Trump relied on in 2016, particularly suburbanites and older voters.
            </p>
            <p>
             A batch of high-quality Florida polls arrived this week — probably some of the last that we’ll see before the election — and they all showed Mr. Biden with an advantage of three to six percentage points among the state’s likely voters. Taken together, the surveys from
             <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_fl_102920.pdf/\" title=\"\">
              Monmouth University
             </a>
             ,
             <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/fl/fl10292020_crosstabs_bgth12.pdf\" title=\"\">
              Quinnipiac University
             </a>
             and
             <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NBC-News_Marist-Poll_FL-Likely-Voters_NOS-and-Tables_202010281159.pdf#page=3\" title=\"\">
              NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College
             </a>
             put Mr. Biden in a strong position to pull together a winning coalition in Florida, which has successfully predicted the victor in the past six presidential elections.
            </p>
            <p>
             In each poll, the difference was within the margin of error, and the polling miss of 2016 — when Florida surveys overestimated Mrs. Clinton’s support by a few points — should give us pause.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mr. Trump’s victory in Florida that year relied heavily on late-deciding voters, and in both the Monmouth and Marist polls, no more than 2 percent of voters said they still didn’t know how they would vote. Turnout is also on track to be considerably higher this year, which leaves less room for certain groups to under-participate, as Democratic voters did in 2016, further throwing off polls.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             The consistency of the findings from this week’s polls suggests that Mr. Trump does have ground to make up. The Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls also showed that he will be fighting the clock: In both surveys, just 17 percent of likely voters said they would vote on Election Day, with the rest planning to cast ballots early in person or by mail.

            <h2>
             The early returns
            </h2>
            <p>
             Turnout has been running high across the state, with more than seven million ballots already cast as of Thursday night. That’s nearly 80 percent of the total votes cast in 2016. After one more weekend of early voting and a few more days of mail ballots arriving, the vote tally could well surpass 2016’s total vote before Election Day even arrives.

            <p>
             Slightly more Democrats have turned out than Republicans, though only by 200,000 votes. That advantage is padded by Mr. Biden’s polling lead among independents, who have cast about one in five ballots so far.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the crosstabs from Monmouth University’s latest poll of Florida were to perfectly predict how Democrats, Republicans and independents are voting, then Mr. Biden would be winning 52 percent of early votes and Mr. Trump 43 percent, according to the
             <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/FL.html\" title=\"\">
              available voter data
             </a>
             on ballots already cast by Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. Those are almost certainly not the exact real numbers, but they’re somewhere in that range.
            </p>
            <p>
             Republicans can count on a last-minute voting surge come Election Day, when they are almost certain to outnumber Democrats going to the polls. But given how many votes will have been cast by then, and since less than one in five voters are telling pollsters they plan to vote that day, it may be a steep uphill climb.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Older voters
            </h2>
            <p>
             Daniel Smith, a professor of political science and pollster at the University of Florida, has been tracking voter turnout by demographic groups, and he said he had been struck by the participation from older voters. Florida is home to vast numbers of retirees, and its diverse population of seniors is a heavily sought-after chunk of the electorate.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The senior vote has been huge so far,” Dr. Smith said, citing numbers showing that two-thirds of voters 65 and older had already voted. That is occurring in traditionally Republican areas — like Sumter County, home to the Villages, which has already matched its 2016 vote total — and more heavily Democratic ones, such as Broward County.
            </p>
           </div>

            <p>
             But the election may be won and lost in the middle, among the many older voters who cast ballots for Mr. Trump four years ago but have turned against him, and whose opposition has only been cemented by his response to the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Trump has doubled down on ‘Covid, Covid, Covid’ and the ‘hoax’ of this virus, and older voters aren’t buying it,” Dr. Smith said.

            <p>
             Yet Mr. Biden hasn’t left the president in the dust; according to the three polls this week, the candidates are roughly splitting older voters in Florida, meaning that Mr. Trump is hanging on to at least a slight majority of white seniors.
            </p>
            <p>
             The president has proved more consistently repellent to college-educated white voters across the state. These voters spurned Mrs. Clinton and supported him overwhelmingly in 2016, when he won 60 percent of white women with college degrees in Florida to Mrs. Clinton’s 37 percent, according to exit polls.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the Marist poll released on Thursday found that those numbers had more than flipped: Sixty-four percent of white, college-educated women in Florida supported Mr. Biden, and 35 percent backed Mr. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             The effect was particularly felt in the state’s suburbs, which Mr. Trump won handily in 2016 — and which largely stuck with Republicans in the 2018 midterm election, defying national trends. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll gave Mr. Biden a 14-point lead in suburban areas.
            </p>
            <h2>
             The diverse Latino population
            </h2>
            <p>
             Like most of the country, Florida tilted Democratic in 2018, with two House seats flipping blue. But in narrow races for senator and governor, Republicans eked out victories.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           <div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.84364820847\" morss_score=\"24.7821395044\">
            <p>
             Part of that was because of a drop in Democratic support among Latino voters. In 2016, 62 percent of Florida’s Latino voters broke for Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls; two years later, just 54 percent voted for the Democratic governor and Senate candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Trump has worked to strengthen his support among Cuban-Americans in particular, and his claims that Democrats are flirting with socialism may carry a particular resonance with these voters, many of whom belong to families that fled the Castro regime. But it was not only among Cuban Latinos that Democrats’ margins suffered in 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the Democratic vote generally rose elsewhere, in the three Florida counties with
             <a href=\"https://www.floridatrend.com/article/15517/hispanic-diversity-in-florida-map\" title=\"\">
              the highest Hispanic populations
             </a>
             , it was down compared with two years earlier. One of those counties, Miami-Dade, has a high concentration of Cubans, but the others, Osceola and Hendry, are more heavily Puerto Rican and Mexican-American.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden was not the Latino community’s
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/us/politics/California-Bernie-Sanders.html\" title=\"\">
              first choice
             </a>
             in the Democratic primaries, and his lead over Mr. Trump among Latino voters has been unreliable since he became the nominee. That’s been particularly true in Florida, where some polls have shown him effectively tied with Mr. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’ve known for a while that Biden was unlikely to hit Clinton’s 2016 numbers, but the goal would be to do better than Nelson and Gillum did in 2018 and be more in line with where Obama was in 2012,” said Carlos Odio, a founder of EquisLabs, a liberal-leaning Latino research firm. That year, exit polls gave President Barack Obama a 21-point lead over Mitt Romney.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far, Mr. Biden has not managed that. Averaging together the results of the Monmouth, Marist and Quinnipiac polls this week, Mr. Biden led by just 12 points among Latinos.
            </p>
            <p>
             Latino voters now account for about one in five ballots cast in Florida, twice their share just 20 years ago.
            </p>
           </div>
           
          
           
            <p>
             Mr. Odio said that Democrats would seek to win over Cuban-American voters in Miami-Dade County, but that they would be largely focused on driving up turnout among the roughly seven in 10 Florida Latinos who are not Cuban.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Biden has a lot more room to grow, and these are populations where there are more late deciders,” Mr. Odio said. Latino voters are more likely than other groups to affiliate with neither party, and to be conflicted about which candidate to choose.
            </p>
            <p>
             But only a few days remain for that decision. And Florida this year intends to be efficient: While it is known for its vote-counting snafus, the state has a long history of accepting high numbers of mail-in ballots, and its election laws allow officials to begin counting them earlier than in many other states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Together with the fact that ballots must be received by Election Day in order to be counted, that means it’s possible the state could manage to declare a winner by the evening of Nov. 3, providing a powerful clue to which candidate is on track to win the presidency.
            </p>

            <p>
             On the weekend of Oct. 10, President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, his former adviser Stephen K. Bannon and a prominent new ally, a Chinese billionaire and Mar-a-Lago member named Guo Wengui, gathered at Mr. Guo’s luxury apartment overlooking Central Park for dinner and cigars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each faced some combination of legal or credibility issues, but on this night they had reason to celebrate: a plan was coming together.
            </p>
            <p>
             That weekend, Mr. Giuliani had delivered to The New York Post a copy of a hard drive purported to be from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, the son of Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The hard drive was filled with what the men claimed was compromising material about the younger Biden that they hoped would sully his father’s reputation.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was the latest in an often-bumbling series of attacks that began two years ago with the goal of undercutting Mr. Biden as a threat to Mr. Trump’s re-election by linking him to the messy personal and business affairs of his son.

             The Post articles were quickly followed by others from Peter Schweizer, the conservative author who in 2016 had promoted unsubstantiated theories about corruption by the Clintons and who in this case was relying on material provided by a former associate of Hunter Biden who is

             While the president has promoted the material relentlessly, many of the Trump-friendly news outlets and other organizations that sustained the effort four years ago have been diminished or sidelined.

             While highlighting questions about the business activities of Hunter Biden and the former vice president’s brother James Biden, Mr. Giuliani and his allies have failed to prove that Joe Biden was involved in or a beneficiary of them.

            <p>
             As he seeks asylum, he has built bridges into Mr. Trump’s orbit. He is a member of Mr. Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Fla., Mar-a-Lago, and he is represented by a lawyer, Daniel T. Podhaskie, who had worked as an outside counsel for the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign.

            <p>
             When Mr. Bannon left the White House, Mr. Guo gave him a $150,000 loan, which Mr. Bannon later told The New York Times was related to a film project about the Chinese Communist Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon afterward, a media company associated with Mr. Guo, Guo Media,

              gave Mr. Bannon a $1 million contract
             </a>
             to introduce its executives to “media personalities” and advise it on industry standards, subjects on which Mr. Bannon had expertise as the former head of Breitbart News.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Guo’s representatives have said he is merely the face of Guo Media and not an owner, though its central property, G News, is closely identified with Mr. Guo and his cause. In April, an associated venture linked to Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon registered as a new business in New York, GTV Media, whose central hub is a Chinese-language, anti-Communist Party video platform.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a GTV video posted on Twitter in July, Mr. Guo described Mr. Bannon and Mr. Podhaskie as directors, noting their ties to Mr. Trump, though Mr. Bannon was removed from the board the next month after his arrest.

             The venture quickly raised $300 million, but as

             The media properties soon seized on a subject that represented a confluence of interest between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo — claims that Hunter Biden used his father’s name to make money from China.

               Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, was charged in August with defrauding donors to a pro-Trump initiative. He maintains his innocence. Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon began working together after Mr. Bannon left the White House in 2017.

             In September, the Guo-related media world started noting chatter about hard drives purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. In late September, the material was teased by the host of an anti-Beijing YouTube show who goes by Lu De. He is closely associated with Mr. Guo and appeared in a photograph with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bannon that was posted on G News and
             <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1304535784335249408\" title=\"\">
              later Twitter
             </a>
             shortly before he first brought up the material.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Weeks before the New York Post articles, Lu De, whose real name, according to GTV, is Wang Dinggang, claimed without evidence on his YouTube program that Chinese sources had sent “three hard disks” with damaging material about Chinese leaders and about Mr. Biden, including videos recorded by the Communist Party, to the Justice Department and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
            </p>
            <p>
             That broadcast
             <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy\" title=\"\">
              was first reported by The Daily Beast
             </a>
             , which also noted that three days later, a Twitter account associated with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo picked up that report. The tweet described “3 hard disk drives of videos and dossiers of Hunter Biden’s connections with the Chinese Communist Party” and said they had the makings of a “Big money and sex scandal!”
            </p>
            <p>
             Salacious material published on the Guo-linked sites is being picked up regularly by fringe outlets like Infowars and Gateway Pundit, providing it
             <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/inside-campaign-pizzagate-hunter-biden-n1244331\" title=\"\">
              a conduit to English-speaking audiences in the United States
             </a>
             . Those outlets, though, have faced hurdles on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms that have sought to block the explicit videos and suspend accounts circulating them.
            </p>
            <p>
             In recent days, GTV featured a notice saying it would continue to publish the videos but would “do our best” to filter graphic depictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bannon asserted that the effort to limit the spread of the New York Post’s articles on social media had backfired, drawing more attention to them. “Social media overplayed this and did us a favor,” Mr. Bannon said.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is unclear if the material featured on the sites linked to Mr. Guo is the same as that provided to The New York Post by Mr. Giuliani, which Mr. Giuliani said came from a laptop turned over to his lawyer by a computer store owner in Delaware.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Mr. Giuliani did not respond to questions about the origins of the materials featured by the Guo-linked outlets, nor did Mr. Guo’s lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             But in a statement, Mr. Guo said, “I support GTV’s efforts to make the public aware of the C.C.P.’s ability to infiltrate and gain influence in the U.S. government, the media and their families and friends through corruption, drugs and sex scandals.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He also said he had “not been involved in providing any information to The N.Y. Post regarding this story.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bannon said that Mr. Guo had not been connected to the acquisition of the hard drive that Mr. Bannon helped Mr. Giuliani provide to The New York Post.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mr. Bannon acknowledged that he pushes content to GTV, which also carries his podcast, War Room.

               The effort to use material about Hunter Biden to undercut his father’s campaign in the closing stages of the election extended beyond Mr. Giuliani to a loose network of conservatives.

             At the same time Mr. Bannon and Mr. Giuliani were shopping the purported hard drive, two other efforts were afoot to disseminate related information on Hunter Biden.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             In one, Mr. Schweizer had obtained a cache of emails from Bevan Cooney, the former Hunter Biden associate who is in prison for fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             Using those emails, Mr. Schweizer and a researcher for his watchdog group, the Government Accountability Institute, have published several stories, including one trying to draw a link between Hunter Biden’s dealings in China and his associates’ efforts to arrange meetings in Washington for Chinese business leaders during the Obama administration.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Schweizer’s institute, of which Mr. Bannon was a co-founder, has received funding from Ms. Mercer’s family, according to tax records. The Mercers have also provided funding to Breitbart News, which was
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/steve-bannon-breitbart-trump.html\" title=\"\">
              previously run by Mr. Bannon
             </a>
             and which has been publishing Mr. Schweizer’s articles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, Mr. Schweizer was consulted in September about the claims made by Mr. Bobulinski, who had worked in 2017 with Hunter and James Biden on a joint venture with a Chinese conglomerate that fizzled.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to two people familiar with the events, Mr. Bobulinski, an investor who had done business related to China, had approached allies of Mr. Trump, seeking assistance to publicize his claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bobulinski, who was admittedly bitter about the way the proposed deal unraveled, was referred to Mr. Passantino, who previously worked in the White House Counsel’s Office and works with a campaign-affiliated group, Lawyers for Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             In an effort to vet Mr. Bobulinski’s claims and documents, Mr. Passantino was referred by Mr. Gingrich, a longtime client, to Mr. Schweizer, who wrote a book in 2018 about business dealings involving Hunter Biden in Ukraine, China and elsewhere.

             Mr. Passantino “just asked advice,” Mr. Gingrich said. “And I said, ‘Look, the guy who knows the most about this is Schweizer,’ so I sent him Schweizer’s email address.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Passantino and Mr. Bobulinski met with Mr. Schweizer in September to review the materials, and Mr. Schweizer said they comported with his own research.
            </p>
            <p>
             Armed with that assurance, Mr. Passantino and Mr. Herschmann, who had worked first as a private lawyer for Mr. Trump, then as a member of the impeachment defense team and more recently as a West Wing official,
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/business/media/hunter-biden-wall-street-journal-trump.html\" title=\"\">
              attended a meeting in Virginia
             </a>
             to provide Mr. Bobulinski’s documents and outline his claims to a reporter from The Wall Street Journal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bobulinski has asserted that the former vice president was aware of, and stood to potentially profit from, the joint venture. Mr. Bobulinski says he met twice with the former vice president after he left office.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Journal

              dug into Mr. Bobulinski’s account
             </a>
             , and in the end reported that corporate records showed “no role for Joe Biden” in the deal and that the documents provided by Mr. Bobulinski “don’t show either Hunter Biden or James Biden discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, Mr. Gingrich, who posted a video this week highlighting some of the material, says it has resonated with Mr. Trump’s supporters, adding that if “you want to maximize your turnout, this is not a bad way to do it.”

             YIWU, China — Deep inside a 10-block-long factory outlet mall in China, the people who supply Americans with their plastic dinosaurs and “Kiss My Bass” baseball caps are confident about a Nov. 3 victory for Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump’s campaign paraphernalia — hats, banners, mugs and practically anything else that can carry a logo — has been selling briskly at shops in the vast wholesale market in the Chinese city of Yiwu. By contrast, shop owners said during recent visits, bulk orders for materials supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have been almost nonexistent.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’ve had four or five shoppers for Trump materials each month,” said Ge Lu, a salesman at one of about 100 shops specializing just in flags, referring to big purchasers who buy banners by the thousands. “We’ve had one Biden shopper this year.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The place isn’t for the average shopper. Yiwu is home to the world’s largest wholesale market, where global retailers look for items to stock on their own shelves. In building after cavernous building, buyers for companies big and small pick through stalls featuring hats, T-shirts, banners, face masks, baby toys, knapsacks, modeling clay and practically any other manufactured product that will delight the world’s fickle consumers.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             It is also home to what Chinese watchers of American politics — a nervous group these days, given souring relations between the two countries and Beijing’s tighter limits on conversation — call the Yiwu Index. Big demand for a presidential candidate’s merchandise, goes the theory, translates into big voter turnout in November.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now, according to the informal and highly unscientific index, Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden substantially.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Trump still has the better chance,” said Zhang Zhijiang, the owner of a caps and hats factory in Jiangsu Province who keeps a sales office in the Yiwu market.

             Followers of the Yiwu Index believe it is reliable, however, and they have history on their side. In 2016, the index consistently predicted a Trump victory. In the final weeks of the campaign, demand for Hillary Clinton hats and other souvenirs weakened considerably.

             China is watching the election nervously. Mr. Trump launched a trade war against Beijing and has taken a more confrontational approach on issues like high-tech export controls, industrial espionage, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, some in China expect little improvement under a Biden administration. They worry that Mr. Biden might even

             Formally named the Yiwu International Trade City, it boasts 12 times the floor space of the Empire State Building, making it look like a small city. Much of the complex was hastily and even shoddily built two decades ago, giving its prematurely aging buildings a ramshackle look.

             It has 70,000 shops, and transactions taking place under its many roofs exceed $60 billion a year. The national government considers the market enough of an indicator of the health of light manufacturing that it manages its own Yiwu Index, of average prices at the shops.

             With some disorderly exceptions, floors are organized by type of merchandise. The warren-like corridors of one floor were devoted to hats. A second housed flags. A third floor featured costumes and masks, while another was devoted to toys.

            <p>
             Ms. Dai, the owner of the baseball cap factory in Qingdao, rents a stall on the hat floor. She said orders for Trump baseball caps had been consistently strong for two years. Biden cap orders were negligible until he became the expected Democratic nominee last spring, but only in recent weeks have these customers wanted to put down cash, she added. The recent orders arrived too late to make and deliver the hats before the election.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the total for Trump cap orders so far this year: “There are tens of thousands this year,” Ms. Dai said. “Biden has a few thousand.”

             Despite its accuracy in 2016, the Yiwu political index has its flaws. Often the buyers are not the campaigns themselves but proxies, like companies and other institutions that want to express their support for a candidate, or simply stores that want to sell popular merchandise.
            </p>
            <p>
             The pandemic has interfered with normal marketing. China has barred practically all international visitors since the end of March, and it has required stringent, two-week quarantines for those who do enter. This has reduced overall activity compared with the 2016 presidential campaign, merchants said.

             The pandemic has also produced different styles of campaigning. Mr. Trump has emphasized large gatherings, with supporters waving pennants and wearing various campaign merchandise, which increases demand for goods from Yiwu. Mr. Biden has avoided holding or encouraging mass gatherings in person and has relied more on online events.
            </p>
            <p>
             As in 2016, Mr. Trump also appears to be gaining a considerable share of his support from people in rural areas, where people may have more room for yard signs and banners. Mr. Biden has done better in cities, where apartment dwellers have less room to wave flags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some vendors think Mr. Biden’s supporters may simply be taking business elsewhere. Mr. Zhang, the hat factory owner in Jiangsu Province, said Biden supporters appeared to be placing more of their baseball cap orders in Vietnam and Myanmar.
            </p>
            <p>
             With trade with the United States increasingly in doubt, a few Yiwu vendors said they were becoming less interested in the American market. In the flag section, some appeared to be appealing instead to China’s rising nationalism. On the flag floor, the corridors were a scarlet sea of red national flags, red Chinese Communist Party pennants and other souvenirs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet Trump paraphernalia is still in demand. At a Halloween mask factory outlet, rubbery Trump masks were consistently popular and completely sold out.
            </p>
            <p>
             The factory created a Biden mask, said Gigi Zhang, the store manager, but nobody had ordered it yet.

WASHINGTON — The moment Chuck Schumer achieved his longtime dream of becoming Senate majority leader, he was in a secure room hiding from a violent pro-Trump mob that was rampaging through the Capitol.
</p>
<p>
As rioters prowled the halls hunting for top lawmakers — Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, later heard that one had been looking for his desk, saying, “Where’s the big Jew?” — he was being evacuated with other leaders to a safe room at an undisclosed location.
</p>
<p>
It was then that news outlets confirmed that Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had won the final Georgia Senate race that would give the party the majority,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/politics/democrats-senate.html\" title=\"\">
handing Mr. Schumer the top job
</a>
. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, turned to the man who had engineered his defeat and offered a brief concession and congratulations.
</p>
<p>
With that, Charles Ellis Schumer, 70, the Brooklyn-raised son of an exterminator and a homemaker, became the
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/nyregion/chuck-schumer-majority-leader.html\" title=\"\">
first New Yorker ever to lead the United States Senate
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
“Jan. 6 was the best of times,” Mr. Schumer said in a recent interview in his office, where he cracked open a Diet Coke. “And it was the worst of times.”
</p>
<p>
His dream job has come with huge challenges and a practically nonexistent margin for error. Mr. Schumer rose to power on the strength of his skills as a party messenger and relentless campaign strategist, not his talent as a legislative tactician.
</p>
<p>
Now it falls to him to maneuver President Biden’s ambitious agenda through a polarized, 50-50 Senate without one vote to spare, navigating between the progressive and moderate factions in his party in the face of a Republican opposition that is more determined than ever.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Schumer passed his first test over the weekend, squeezing Mr. Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus measure through the Senate along party lines — an effort that nearly fell apart as
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/us/politics/joe-manchin-senate.html\" title=\"\">
Senator Joe Manchin III
</a>
, Democrat of West Virginia and a crucial moderate, balked at the 11th hour. Mr. Schumer negotiated a concession, and the bill passed, paving the way for
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html\" title=\"\">
emergency aid and the most far-reaching antipoverty effort
</a>
in a generation.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Schumer.
</p>
<p>
The effort forced the Senate leader to straddle his party’s centrist and progressive wings, a trick he will have to master if he hopes to keep the president’s agenda on track and Democrats in control of the chamber, as well as fending off a possible 2024 primary challenge from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile progressive from the Bronx.
</p>
<p>
Asked what he would do about her, Mr. Schumer shrugged and said he talked to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez “all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“What I’ve done throughout my career,” he added. “I do my job well, and everything works out.”

<p>
If Mr. Schumer’s victory was overshadowed by the violence of Jan. 6 and the chaos that followed, it has not slowed his pace or scaled back his plans.
</p>
<p>
After the stimulus measure, the next items on his agenda are all ambitious and difficult, beginning with a sweeping infrastructure and jobs proposal aimed at addressing climate change, economic inequality and racial justice.
</p>
<p>
The bills would be huge victories for Democrats, showing that they can deliver the progressive policies they have promised. But Mr. Schumer faces formidable hurdles in keeping together his ideologically diverse caucus, which includes conservative Democrats and a self-described democratic socialist. He also will have to outmaneuver Mr. McConnell, who likes to call himself the “
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/us/mitch-mcconnell-impeachment-strategy.html\" title=\"\">
grim reaper
</a>
” because of a long history of using his mastery of Senate strategy to obstruct Democratic initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Schumer, who is more of a happy warrior, has traditionally been less focused on the intricacies of the Senate floor. But at a moment when unity is critical to his party’s success, he has attributes that Democrats may need more: strong relationships with his colleagues and a knack for reading their political moods, along with a flair for communication.
</p>
<p>
“I know every one of my colleagues’ numbers by heart,” he said in the interview, waving his signature flip phone in the air. “I love my members. I truly love them!”
</p>
<p>
(Asked at a news conference on Saturday whether that included Mr. Manchin, who single-handedly delayed the stimulus measure for about 10 hours by haggling over jobless aid, Mr. Schumer grinned and said enthusiastically, “Yes!”)

Mr. Schumer can be sentimental (President
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/19/upshot/trump-complete-insult-list.html\" title=\"\">
Donald J. Trump mocked him
</a>
as “Cryin’ Chuck” after he wept during a news conference objecting to the travel ban). Since 1994, he has carried with him a letter a Union soldier, Sullivan Ballou, wrote to his wife before he was killed in the Civil War to remind himself of the “best of America.”
</p>
<p>
The first Jewish person to hold the top Senate job, Mr. Schumer peppers his speech with Yiddish expressions and phrases like “holy moly.” He once cried so hard at the movie “Free Willy” that his daughters left the theater out of embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
He can also be a bit of a ham. His staff has imposed some rules for him when appearing in public: “No singing. No dancing. No hats.”
</p>
<p>
“I love to sing. I love to dance,” he says, “and I’m lousy at both.”
</p>
<p>
The effusive personality has helped him develop personal bonds with lawmakers of every ideological stripe. Mr. Schumer has 11 Democrats on his leadership team that meets each Monday, including the Senate’s most conservative, Mr. Manchin, and its two most left-learning members, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent.
</p>
<p>
Most of them refer to him as a friend.
</p>
<p>
“Anybody and everybody can work with Chuck,” said Mr. Manchin, who because of the tight Senate margin is a crucial swing vote on everything that crosses Mr. Schumer’s desk.
</p>
<p>
Mr. McConnell’s willingness to employ hardball tactics might give him the “negotiating advantage in many circumstances,” said Ms. Warren, whom Mr. Schumer wooed to run for the Senate in 2012 over a meal at Hunan Dynasty, his favorite Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol.
</p>
<p>
“But when the Democrats stand together behind Chuck,” Ms. Warren said, “Chuck has shown that he can deliver.”
</p>
<p>
Less clear is how effective he can be at courting the moderate Republicans he will most likely need to push through key priorities in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to advance most major bills. His relationship with Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who may be the single most important swing vote, grew particularly toxic after Mr. Schumer attacked her during her latest re-election race.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Schumer’s political action committee ran ads accusing Ms. Collins’s husband of enriching himself through the opioid crisis and charging that she had “pocketed” money from drug companies.
</p>
<p>
“His tactics were unworthy of a Senate race,” Ms. Collins said, calling the ads “deceptive” and “shameful.”
</p>
<p>
She said Mr. Schumer’s only goal was to “jam the Republicans and force partisan, highly political votes on nearly every major issue.”
</p>
<p>
“So far,” she said of the majority leader, “the signs are not promising.”

Mr. Schumer was not always regarded as a liberal partisan, but his path to the top Senate job has involved considerable reinvention. When he campaigned for the Senate in 1998, he described himself as an “

tough on crime.
</a>
”
</p>
<p>
His critics have long portrayed him as too cozy with Wall Street, and a
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14schumer.html\" title=\"\">
review of his Senate record by The New York Times
</a>
in 2008 showed that he repeatedly took steps to protect industry players from government oversight and tougher rules.
</p>
<p>
But as his party has moved to the left, Mr. Schumer has aligned himself more closely with its progressive wing. In addition to backing a clean-energy jobs initiative that is part of the infrastructure plan, he has been among the leading voices calling on Mr. Biden to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt.
</p>
<p>
“The world changes, and you have to change with it,” Mr. Schumer said. “Income inequality is much worse. Climate change is much more dangerous.”
</p>
<p>
His ability to work both wings of his party was on display on Friday, when Mr. Schumer spent hours in painstaking negotiations with Mr. Manchin, who wanted to scale back unemployment payments, a core liberal priority in the stimulus bill. As action stalled, Republicans gleefully laid the chaos at the new majority leader’s feet.
</p>
<p>
“Chuck Schumer has officially lost control,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said in a one-line statement.
</p>
<p>
But in the end — after a marathon series of calls with Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, Mr. Manchin and others — Mr. Schumer had a deal, and he held Democrats together in beating back Republican attempts to erode support for the bill with politically tricky votes.
</p>
<p>
“Not a single member defected on any significant vote,” Mr. Schumer said.

<p>
Those who know Mr. Schumer say he has been preparing for his current job for nearly his entire life.
</p>
<p>
His first foray into politics came in 1968, during a low moment in his freshman year at Harvard, after the basketball coach dashed his hopes of playing for the team.
</p>
<p>
A distraught Mr. Schumer wrote to his mother, saying he wanted to come home and go to Brooklyn College. But then he was invited to join the Harvard Young Democrats, whose backing for Eugene McCarthy was part of an antiwar movement that swept the nation and ultimately prompted President Lyndon B. Johnson not to seek another term.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a Yiddish word — beshert — God’s hand,” Mr. Schumer said. “I said to myself, ‘Holy moly! A ragtag group of students and other assorted nobodies toppled the most powerful man in the world? This is what I want to dedicate my life to.’”
</p>
<p>
So at 23, he ran for a seat in the New York State Legislature, making him the second-youngest person after Theodore Roosevelt to do so. He won, and has never lost a race in the nearly half-century since, rising to the House of Representatives in 1981 and eventually to the Senate in 1999.

<p>
One task that Mr. Schumer especially loves, and to which he owes his current post, is his relentless work recruiting winning Democratic candidates. It is a major reason that, in a year when his party lost 13 seats in the House, it was able to
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/warnock-loeffler-ossoff-perdue-georgia-senate.html\" title=\"\">
recapture the Senate
</a>
, albeit by the thinnest of margins.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Warren recalled Mr. Schumer “hammering” her in 2011 until she agreed to run. He has had dozens of similar meetings over the years.
</p>
<p>
As John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, pursued the Democratic presidential nomination last year, Mr. Schumer was pestering him from the sidelines to consider a Senate run. He waited until a few days after Mr. Hickenlooper had left the presidential race, summoned the Coloradan and his wife for a meeting that lasted five hours and made his case. Mr. Hickenlooper ran and
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/us/politics/colorado-hickenlooper.html\" title=\"\">
won, picking up a crucial Senate seat
</a>
for Democrats.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Schumer has had his share of disappointments, too. He wanted badly for Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader, to challenge the Republican Kelly Loeffler for her Senate seat, but Ms. Abrams had her sights set on another office and instead urged him to choose the Rev.

</p>
<p>
It took about four months of cajoling by Mr. Schumer, but Mr. Warnock eventually agreed.
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/us/politics/raphael-warnock-georgia-senate.html\" title=\"\">
His victory
</a>
in a runoff in January was one of the final two pickups that handed Senate control to the Democrats.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Abrams recalled steeling herself as she called Mr. Schumer to let him know she would not run.
</p>
<p>
“Having worked with people with big personalities, there was a range of responses it could have been, and his was instinctive kindness,” she said. “Which is why, when I get a call from Chuck Schumer, I take it.”

            <p>
             WASHINGTON — The moment Chuck Schumer achieved his longtime dream of becoming Senate majority leader, he was in a secure room hiding from a violent pro-Trump mob that was rampaging through the Capitol.
            </p>
            <p>
             As rioters prowled the halls hunting for top lawmakers — Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, later heard that one had been looking for his desk, saying, “Where’s the big Jew?” — he was being evacuated with other leaders to a safe room at an undisclosed location.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was then that news outlets confirmed that Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had won the final Georgia Senate race that would give the party the majority,

             . Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, turned to the man who had engineered his defeat and offered a brief concession and congratulations.
            </p>
            <p>
             With that, Charles Ellis Schumer, 70, the Brooklyn-raised son of an exterminator and a homemaker, became the

            <p>
             “Jan. 6 was the best of times,” Mr. Schumer said in a recent interview in his office, where he cracked open a Diet Coke. “And it was the worst of times.”
            </p>
            <p>
             His dream job has come with huge challenges and a practically nonexistent margin for error. Mr. Schumer rose to power on the strength of his skills as a party messenger and relentless campaign strategist, not his talent as a legislative tactician.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now it falls to him to maneuver President Biden’s ambitious agenda through a polarized, 50-50 Senate without one vote to spare, navigating between the progressive and moderate factions in his party in the face of a Republican opposition that is more determined than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Schumer passed his first test over the weekend, squeezing Mr. Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus measure through the Senate along party lines — an effort that nearly fell apart as

             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html\" title=\"\">

            </p>
            <p>
             “I’ve never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Schumer.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             The effort forced the Senate leader to straddle his party’s centrist and progressive wings, a trick he will have to master if he hopes to keep the president’s agenda on track and Democrats in control of the chamber, as well as fending off a possible 2024 primary challenge from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile progressive from the Bronx.
            </p>
            <p>
             Asked what he would do about her, Mr. Schumer shrugged and said he talked to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez “all the time.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “What I’ve done throughout my career,” he added. “I do my job well, and everything works out.”

            <p>
             The bills would be huge victories for Democrats, showing that they can deliver the progressive policies they have promised. But Mr. Schumer faces formidable hurdles in keeping together his ideologically diverse caucus, which includes conservative Democrats and a self-described democratic socialist. He also will have to outmaneuver Mr. McConnell, who likes to call himself the “

            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Schumer, who is more of a happy warrior, has traditionally been less focused on the intricacies of the Senate floor. But at a moment when unity is critical to his party’s success, he has attributes that Democrats may need more: strong relationships with his colleagues and a knack for reading their political moods, along with a flair for communication.

              Donald J. Trump mocked him
             </a>
             as “Cryin’ Chuck” after he wept during a news conference objecting to the travel ban). Since 1994, he has carried with him a letter a Union soldier, Sullivan Ballou, wrote to his wife before he was killed in the Civil War to remind himself of the “best of America.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The first Jewish person to hold the top Senate job, Mr. Schumer peppers his speech with Yiddish expressions and phrases like “holy moly.” He once cried so hard at the movie “Free Willy” that his daughters left the theater out of embarrassment.
            </p>
            <p>
             He can also be a bit of a ham. His staff has imposed some rules for him when appearing in public: “No singing. No dancing. No hats.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “I love to sing. I love to dance,” he says, “and I’m lousy at both.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The effusive personality has helped him develop personal bonds with lawmakers of every ideological stripe. Mr. Schumer has 11 Democrats on his leadership team that meets each Monday, including the Senate’s most conservative, Mr. Manchin, and its two most left-learning members, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent.
            </p>

             Most of them refer to him as a friend.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Anybody and everybody can work with Chuck,” said Mr. Manchin, who because of the tight Senate margin is a crucial swing vote on everything that crosses Mr. Schumer’s desk.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. McConnell’s willingness to employ hardball tactics might give him the “negotiating advantage in many circumstances,” said Ms. Warren, whom Mr. Schumer wooed to run for the Senate in 2012 over a meal at Hunan Dynasty, his favorite Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol.
            </p>
            <p>
             “But when the Democrats stand together behind Chuck,” Ms. Warren said, “Chuck has shown that he can deliver.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Less clear is how effective he can be at courting the moderate Republicans he will most likely need to push through key priorities in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to advance most major bills. His relationship with Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who may be the single most important swing vote, grew particularly toxic after Mr. Schumer attacked her during her latest re-election race.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Schumer’s political action committee ran ads accusing Ms. Collins’s husband of enriching himself through the opioid crisis and charging that she had “pocketed” money from drug companies.
            </p>
            <p>
             “His tactics were unworthy of a Senate race,” Ms. Collins said, calling the ads “deceptive” and “shameful.”
            </p>
            <p>
             She said Mr. Schumer’s only goal was to “jam the Republicans and force partisan, highly political votes on nearly every major issue.”

             Mr. Schumer was not always regarded as a liberal partisan, but his path to the top Senate job has involved considerable reinvention. When he campaigned for the Senate in 1998, he described himself as an “

              review of his Senate record by The New York Times
             </a>
             in 2008 showed that he repeatedly took steps to protect industry players from government oversight and tougher rules.
            </p>
            <p>
             But as his party has moved to the left, Mr. Schumer has aligned himself more closely with its progressive wing. In addition to backing a clean-energy jobs initiative that is part of the infrastructure plan, he has been among the leading voices calling on Mr. Biden to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The world changes, and you have to change with it,” Mr. Schumer said. “Income inequality is much worse. Climate change is much more dangerous.”
            </p>
            <p>
             His ability to work both wings of his party was on display on Friday, when Mr. Schumer spent hours in painstaking negotiations with Mr. Manchin, who wanted to scale back unemployment payments, a core liberal priority in the stimulus bill. As action stalled, Republicans gleefully laid the chaos at the new majority leader’s feet.
            </p>

             But in the end — after a marathon series of calls with Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, Mr. Manchin and others — Mr. Schumer had a deal, and he held Democrats together in beating back Republican attempts to erode support for the bill with politically tricky votes.

             “Not a single member defected on any significant vote,” Mr. Schumer said.

             Those who know Mr. Schumer say he has been preparing for his current job for nearly his entire life.
            </p>
            <p>
             His first foray into politics came in 1968, during a low moment in his freshman year at Harvard, after the basketball coach dashed his hopes of playing for the team.
            </p>
            <p>
             A distraught Mr. Schumer wrote to his mother, saying he wanted to come home and go to Brooklyn College. But then he was invited to join the Harvard Young Democrats, whose backing for Eugene McCarthy was part of an antiwar movement that swept the nation and ultimately prompted President Lyndon B. Johnson not to seek another term.
            </p>
            <p>
             “There’s a Yiddish word — beshert — God’s hand,” Mr. Schumer said. “I said to myself, ‘Holy moly! A ragtag group of students and other assorted nobodies toppled the most powerful man in the world? This is what I want to dedicate my life to.’”
            </p>
            <p>
             So at 23, he ran for a seat in the New York State Legislature, making him the second-youngest person after Theodore Roosevelt to do so. He won, and has never lost a race in the nearly half-century since, rising to the House of Representatives in 1981 and eventually to the Senate in 1999.

             One task that Mr. Schumer especially loves, and to which he owes his current post, is his relentless work recruiting winning Democratic candidates. It is a major reason that, in a year when his party lost 13 seats in the House, it was able to

            </p>
            <p>
             As John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, pursued the Democratic presidential nomination last year, Mr. Schumer was pestering him from the sidelines to consider a Senate run. He waited until a few days after Mr. Hickenlooper had left the presidential race, summoned the Coloradan and his wife for a meeting that lasted five hours and made his case. Mr. Hickenlooper ran and

             Mr. Schumer has had his share of disappointments, too. He wanted badly for Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader, to challenge the Republican Kelly Loeffler for her Senate seat, but Ms. Abrams had her sights set on another office and instead urged him to choose the Rev.

<p>
American political leaders have learned a few things in the last 12 years, since the nation last tried to claw its way out of an economic hole.
</p>
<p>
Among them: People like having money. Congress has the power to give it to them. In an economic crisis, budget deficits don’t have to be scary. And it is better for both the economy and the democratic legitimacy of a rescue effort when elected leaders choose to help people by spending money, versus when pointy-headed technocrats help by obscure interventions in financial markets.
</p>
<p>
Lawmakers rarely phrase things so bluntly, but those are the implications of a pivot in American economic policy over the last year, culminating with the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill. It is set to pass the House within days and be signed by President Biden soon after. And while this vote will fall along partisan lines, stimulus bills with similar goals passed with bipartisan support last year.
</p>
<p>
Leaders of both parties have become more willing to use their power to extract the nation from economic crisis, taking the primary role for managing the ups and downs of the economy that they ceded for much of the last four decades, most notably in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis.
</p>
<p>
It is an implicit rejection of an era in which the Federal Reserve was the main actor in trying to stabilize the nation’s economy. Now, elected officials are embracing the government’s ability to borrow and spend — the “great fiscal power of the United States” as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has
<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200429.pdf\" title=\"\">
called it
</a>
— as the primary tool to fight a crisis.
</p>
<p>
“That’s really been the story of this recovery,” Mr. Powell said at a recent hearing. “Fiscal policy has really stepped up.”
</p>
<p>
The new relief bill is similarly a rejection of the concerns of centrist economists, including the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers and the former I.M.F. chief economist Olivier Blanchard, that its size and structure invite inflation or other problems. Democratic lawmakers have concluded that the favorable politics of this plan outweigh such risks.
</p>
<p>
If sustained, this assertion of control over economic management by elected leaders would be as momentous a change as the one that followed the Paul Volcker Fed in the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
“This is an enduring regime shift,” said Paul McCulley, who teaches at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. “Having the tools of economic stabilization work a whole lot more through the fiscal channel and a whole lot less through the monetary channel is a profound, pro-democracy policy mix.”
</p>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.96992481203\" morss_score=\"31.769924812\">
<p>
It is in distinct contrast with the experience after the 2008 financial crisis.
</p>
<p>
There was a large 2009 fiscal stimulus action, but a mix of legislative politics and deficit concerns by some officials in President Barack Obama’s inner circle restrained its size. Many of its components were relatively invisible to the average voter. And when the economy remained weak into 2010 and beyond, Republicans and many Democrats focused on deficit reduction. “Stimulus” became a dirty word in Washington.
</p>
<p>
The Fed stepped in, undertaking quantitative easing (essentially, buying bonds with newly created money) and other untested strategies in an effort to keep the expansion going.
</p>
<p>
But central bankers’ tools are limited. They can adjust interest rates and push money into the financial system in hope of making credit easier to obtain. That can spur more investment and spending, which in turn can generate more jobs and higher wages.
</p>
<p>
Sound circuitous? It is — the economics equivalent of a triple bank shot in billiards.
</p>
<p>
In the 2010s, the strategy sort of worked. There was no dip back into recession, and the expansion was the longest on record, until the pandemic ended it. But it took years and years for the economy to return to health, and it was a deeply unequal recovery in which owners of financial assets saw the biggest gains. That the effort was led by unelected central bankers reduced its democratic legitimacy, by appearing as if it were merely an effort by elitist institutions to protect the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone else.
</p>
<p>
“You can do it and it can be successful, but the income and wealth inequality consequences of it will stink to high heaven,” Professor McCulley said. “You can do it that way, but it is anathema to democratic inclusion.”
</p>
<p>
By contrast, fiscal authorities can spend money directly, funneling it where it is needed, without expectation of being paid back. The United States has done exactly that over the last year on a scale with no parallel since World War II.
</p>
<p>
The new $1.9 trillion package includes, among other provisions, $1,400 payments to most Americans, a new child care tax credit that will put $300 per month in the bank accounts of most parents of a young child, help for those facing eviction or foreclosure, and billions of dollars in grants for small businesses. Public opinion polling finds it considerably

more popular
</a>
than other major domestic policy legislation in recent years.
</p>
</div>
<p>
“For all the failures and weaknesses of American democracy over recent months, this is a dramatic demonstration of democracy’s power to act,” said Adam Tooze, a Columbia University economic historian who has written extensively of the aftermath of the financial crisis. “When it comes to delivering popular policies at the right moment, working on the basis of established constitutional norms, they’re doing that, which is infinitely to be preferred to an economic policy that depends on well-meaning enlightened technocrats.”
</p>
<p>
Some lawmakers, especially on the left, have raised the notion that relying on congressional action to support the economy improves democratic legitimacy.

payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number.

Buying insurance through the government program known as COBRA would temporarily become a lot cheaper. COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it’s expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30. A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either.

This credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. “That will be helpful to people at the lower end” of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.

There would be a big one for people who already have debt. You wouldn’t have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you’ve been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if Congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. This would be the case for debt forgiven between Jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025.

The bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes.

“This legislation has everything to do with restoring the confidence of the American people in democracy and in their government, and if we can’t respond to the pain of working families today, we don’t deserve to be here,” said Senator Bernie Sanders of the Biden bill, known as the American Rescue Plan Act.
</p>
<p>
Republicans unanimously opposed the Biden legislation, but it has not been quite the scorched-earth opposition to deficit-widening action seen during the Obama administration.

As evidenced by previous rounds of pandemic relief, there has been enough common ground between Democrats and Republicans to reach bipartisan agreements of relatively large scale, including the $2 trillion CARES Act enacted last March.
</p>
<p>
“A relief package like this one might not have been everything both parties wanted, but a compromise deal that provides help to Americans is better than no deal at all,” said Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, at the outset of the House debate on a $900 billion bipartisan bill in late December.
</p>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"24.0\">
<p>
All in all, Congress and the Trump and Biden administrations have authorized about $6 trillion in pandemic relief spending over the last year, about 28 percent of 2019 G.D.P. (Less than that will ultimately be spent, because the economy’s improvement has left some programs with more money allocated than they needed.)
</p>
<p>
The bipartisan agreement around many of the components of the pandemic aid legislation suggests a future model for how the United States government responds to economic crises. For example, in the past the federal government has extended the duration that jobless people are eligible for unemployment insurance payments during recessions, but has not expanded the size of those payments.
</p>

The CARES Act, by contrast, increased unemployment checks by $600 a week, aiming to replace the income lost by those forced out of work. Subsequent legislation has included smaller increases. Economists generally say that this has been a well-targeted policy that has helped temporarily jobless people to keep paying their bills — and has softened the collapse of demand in the economy.

“We’re at a watershed moment where this type of tool will be used in future recessions,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist of the global accounting firm KPMG. “What we did here is different and unique, and we are going to learn whether it was effective at providing a bridge to the other side of the pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
There are risks in the Biden administration’s approach, of course. If the concerns described by Mr. Summers and Mr. Blanchard about the size of the new relief bill materialize, and the result is excessive inflation or some type of crisis, Democrats will pay a price for their actions.
</p>
<p>
But that’s the thing about democracy: It has much clearer mechanisms for holding elected officials accountable for their economic policy decisions than it does for scrutinizing appointed experts for their interest rate policies. If Americans don’t like the results, they have a straightforward way to make it known: at the ballot box in November 2022 and November 2024.

             American political leaders have learned a few things in the last 12 years, since the nation last tried to claw its way out of an economic hole.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among them: People like having money. Congress has the power to give it to them. In an economic crisis, budget deficits don’t have to be scary. And it is better for both the economy and the democratic legitimacy of a rescue effort when elected leaders choose to help people by spending money, versus when pointy-headed technocrats help by obscure interventions in financial markets.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawmakers rarely phrase things so bluntly, but those are the implications of a pivot in American economic policy over the last year, culminating with the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill. It is set to pass the House within days and be signed by President Biden soon after. And while this vote will fall along partisan lines, stimulus bills with similar goals passed with bipartisan support last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Leaders of both parties have become more willing to use their power to extract the nation from economic crisis, taking the primary role for managing the ups and downs of the economy that they ceded for much of the last four decades, most notably in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             It is an implicit rejection of an era in which the Federal Reserve was the main actor in trying to stabilize the nation’s economy. Now, elected officials are embracing the government’s ability to borrow and spend — the “great fiscal power of the United States” as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has
             <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200429.pdf\" title=\"\">
              called it
             </a>
             — as the primary tool to fight a crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
             “That’s really been the story of this recovery,” Mr. Powell said at a recent hearing. “Fiscal policy has really stepped up.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The new relief bill is similarly a rejection of the concerns of centrist economists, including the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers and the former I.M.F. chief economist Olivier Blanchard, that its size and structure invite inflation or other problems. Democratic lawmakers have concluded that the favorable politics of this plan outweigh such risks.
            </p>
            <p>
             If sustained, this assertion of control over economic management by elected leaders would be as momentous a change as the one that followed the Paul Volcker Fed in the 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
             “This is an enduring regime shift,” said Paul McCulley, who teaches at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. “Having the tools of economic stabilization work a whole lot more through the fiscal channel and a whole lot less through the monetary channel is a profound, pro-democracy policy mix.”
            </p>

             It is in distinct contrast with the experience after the 2008 financial crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was a large 2009 fiscal stimulus action, but a mix of legislative politics and deficit concerns by some officials in President Barack Obama’s inner circle restrained its size. Many of its components were relatively invisible to the average voter. And when the economy remained weak into 2010 and beyond, Republicans and many Democrats focused on deficit reduction. “Stimulus” became a dirty word in Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Fed stepped in, undertaking quantitative easing (essentially, buying bonds with newly created money) and other untested strategies in an effort to keep the expansion going.
            </p>
            <p>
             But central bankers’ tools are limited. They can adjust interest rates and push money into the financial system in hope of making credit easier to obtain. That can spur more investment and spending, which in turn can generate more jobs and higher wages.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sound circuitous? It is — the economics equivalent of a triple bank shot in billiards.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the 2010s, the strategy sort of worked. There was no dip back into recession, and the expansion was the longest on record, until the pandemic ended it. But it took years and years for the economy to return to health, and it was a deeply unequal recovery in which owners of financial assets saw the biggest gains. That the effort was led by unelected central bankers reduced its democratic legitimacy, by appearing as if it were merely an effort by elitist institutions to protect the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You can do it and it can be successful, but the income and wealth inequality consequences of it will stink to high heaven,” Professor McCulley said. “You can do it that way, but it is anathema to democratic inclusion.”
            </p>
            <p>
             By contrast, fiscal authorities can spend money directly, funneling it where it is needed, without expectation of being paid back. The United States has done exactly that over the last year on a scale with no parallel since World War II.

             The new $1.9 trillion package includes, among other provisions, $1,400 payments to most Americans, a new child care tax credit that will put $300 per month in the bank accounts of most parents of a young child, help for those facing eviction or foreclosure, and billions of dollars in grants for small businesses.

             “For all the failures and weaknesses of American democracy over recent months, this is a dramatic demonstration of democracy’s power to act,” said Adam Tooze, a Columbia University economic historian who has written extensively of the aftermath of the financial crisis. “When it comes to delivering popular policies at the right moment, working on the basis of established constitutional norms, they’re doing that, which is infinitely to be preferred to an economic policy that depends on well-meaning enlightened technocrats.”

                    payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number.

                    Buying insurance through the government program known as COBRA would temporarily become a lot cheaper. COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it’s expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30. A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either.

                    This credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. “That will be helpful to people at the lower end” of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.

                    There would be a big one for people who already have debt. You wouldn’t have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you’ve been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if Congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. This would be the case for debt forgiven between Jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025.

                    The bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes. About $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. The vast majority of it would replenish the so-called Coronavirus Relief Fund, created by the CARES Act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments,

Household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic.

             “This legislation has everything to do with restoring the confidence of the American people in democracy and in their government, and if we can’t respond to the pain of working families today, we don’t deserve to be here,” said Senator Bernie Sanders of the Biden bill, known as the American Rescue Plan Act.

             As evidenced by previous rounds of pandemic relief, there has been enough common ground between Democrats and Republicans to reach bipartisan agreements of relatively large scale, including the $2 trillion CARES Act enacted last March.

             “A relief package like this one might not have been everything both parties wanted, but a compromise deal that provides help to Americans is better than no deal at all,” said Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, at the outset of the House debate on a $900 billion bipartisan bill in late December.

             All in all, Congress and the Trump and Biden administrations have authorized about $6 trillion in pandemic relief spending over the last year, about 28 percent of 2019 G.D.P. (Less than that will ultimately be spent, because the economy’s improvement has left some programs with more money allocated than they needed.)

For example, in the past the federal government has extended the duration that jobless people are eligible for unemployment insurance payments during recessions, but has not expanded the size of those payments.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CARES Act, by contrast, increased unemployment checks by $600 a week, aiming to replace the income lost by those forced out of work. Subsequent legislation has included smaller increases. Economists generally say that this has been a well-targeted policy that has helped temporarily jobless people to keep paying their bills — and has softened the collapse of demand in the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’re at a watershed moment where this type of tool will be used in future recessions,” said Constance Hunter, chief economist of the global accounting firm KPMG. “What we did here is different and unique, and we are going to learn whether it was effective at providing a bridge to the other side of the pandemic.”
            </p>
            <p>
             There are risks in the Biden administration’s approach, of course. If the concerns described by Mr. Summers and Mr. Blanchard about the size of the new relief bill materialize, and the result is excessive inflation or some type of crisis, Democrats will pay a price for their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that’s the thing about democracy: It has much clearer mechanisms for holding elected officials accountable for their economic policy decisions than it does for scrutinizing appointed experts for their interest rate policies. If Americans don’t like the results, they have a straightforward way to make it known: at the ballot box in November 2022 and November 2024.

<p>
WASHINGTON — When President Biden pledged last week to amass enough vaccine by late May to inoculate every adult in the United States, the pronouncement was greeted as a triumphant acceleration of a vaccination campaign that seemed to be faltering only weeks earlier.
</p>
<p>
And it is true that production of two of the three federally authorized vaccines has sped up in part because of the demands and directives of the new president’s coronavirus team.
</p>
<p>
But the announcement was also a triumph of another kind: public relations. Because Mr. Biden had tamped down expectations early, the quicker timetable for vaccine production conjured an image of a White House running on all cylinders and leaving its predecessor’s effort in the dust.
</p>
<p>
A closer look at the ramp-up announced last week offers a more mixed picture, one in which the new administration expanded and bulked up a vaccine production effort whose key elements were in place when Mr. Biden took over for President Donald J. Trump. Both administrations deserve credit, although neither wants to grant much to the other.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration has taken two major steps that helped hasten vaccine production in the near term. Even before Mr. Biden was inaugurated, his aides determined that by invoking
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/defense-production-act-virus.html\" title=\"\">
the Korean War-era Defense Production Act
</a>
, the federal government could help Pfizer obtain the heavy machinery it needed to expand its plant in Kalamazoo, Mich. The Trump administration had repeatedly invoked that law, but its order for Pfizer only covered single-use supplies like plastic liners, not durable factory equipment.
</p>
<p>
Crucially, Mr. Biden’s top aides drove
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
another vaccine manufacturer, Johnson &amp; Johnson
</a>
, to force a key subcontractor into round-the-clock operations so its vaccine could be bottled faster. That company had fallen behind on the production targets laid out in its federal contract. Only after Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House’s chief pandemic adviser, and Dr. David Kessler, who oversees the vaccine effort, demanded the company commit more resources did it publicly pledge to meet a crucial deadline in May.
</p>
<p>
At a White House vaccine “summit” on Wednesday afternoon,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/10/world/covid-19-coronavirus/biden-will-announce-he-intends-to-secure-another-100-million-doses-of-johnson-johnsons-vaccine\" title=\"\">
Mr. Biden will announce
</a>
that he intends to secure an additional 100 million doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson single-shot vaccine by the end of this year, with the goal of having enough on hand to vaccinate children and, if necessary, administer booster doses or reformulate the vaccine to combat emerging variants of the virus.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, though, Mr. Biden benefited hugely from the waves of vaccine production that the Trump administration had set in motion. As both Pfizer and Moderna found their manufacturing footing, they were able to double and triple the outputs from their factories.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden had been in office less than a month when Moderna announced that it could deliver 200 million doses by the end of May, a month earlier than scheduled, simply because it had become faster at production. Pfizer was able to shave off even more time, moving up the timetable to deliver its 200 million doses by a full two months, partly because of newfound efficiencies and partly because it was given credit for six doses per vial instead of five.
</p>
<p>
All this enabled Mr. Biden to announce that his administration would have enough doses in hand by the end of May to cover all 257 million adults, two months earlier than he had promised just a few weeks earlier. His aides noted that on Sunday, the nation hit a daily record of 2.9 million shots, three and a half times as many as were given on Inauguration Day.
</p>
<p>
“Throughout our response, we’ve provided clear timelines based on the available, authorized vaccines,” said Kevin Munoz, a White House assistant press secretary. “We don’t plan to just meet these timelines but rather to overperform them.”

To Trump administration aides, the new president’s crowing rings off-key. Mr. Biden is proclaiming victory off his predecessor’s achievements while wrongly grumbling about a mess he says he inherited, they say.
</p>
<p>
“They criticize what we did, but they are using our playbook every step of the way,” said Paul Mango, the Trump administration’s deputy chief of staff for health policy and a senior official in the crash vaccine development effort then known as Operation Warp Speed. He said Mr. Trump’s team oversaw the construction or expansion of nearly two dozen plants involved in vaccine production and invoked the Defense Production Act 18 times to ensure those factories had sufficient supplies.

<p>
The Biden team is “maintaining a very nice trajectory,” Mr. Mango said. “But don’t criticize us to make yourselves look better.”
</p>
<p>
Still, corporate, state and federal officials agree that Mr. Biden’s White House has been more active than his predecessor’s in trying to build up the nation’s vaccine stock.
</p>
<p>
The new administration’s relationship with Pfizer is markedly better. Mr. Trump and his aides had accused the company of slow-walking its vaccine development to hurt Mr. Trump’s re-election bid. The company
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html\" title=\"\">
announced its vaccine was robustly effective on Nov. 9
</a>
, nearly a week after Election Day, then filed its application for emergency use authorization on Nov. 20.
</p>
<p>
Pfizer officials privately suggested that the Trump administration not only was wrongfully bad-mouthing the company but also had refused for months to invoke the Defense Production Act to order suppliers to prioritize Pfizer’s needs, as it did for the other vaccine developers under federal contract.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden’s aides started talking to Pfizer executives about what the company needed to make more doses even before Inauguration Day. When Mr. Biden
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
traveled to Michigan
</a>
on Feb. 19 to visit Pfizer’s plant, Dr. Albert Bourla, the company’s chief executive, effusively praised the new administration as “a great ally,” saying officials had helped the company secure critical materials and equipment.

<p>
The biggest piece of locking in enough doses to cover the nation’s adults before June was Johnson &amp; Johnson. As recently as two weeks ago, Dr. Richard Nettles, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vice president for medical affairs in the United States, would say only that the company would supply 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million doses by the end of June. That fell short of its contract for 37 million doses by the end of March and 87 million by the end of May.

Providers in the U.S. are administering about 2.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines per day, on average. About 59 million people have received at least one dose, and about 31 million have been fully vaccinated.

reported on Tuesday
</a>
that Johnson &amp; Johnson had informed European Union officials that production problems might delay shipments, and Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had heard similar warnings from the company.
</p>
<p>
In the United States, the company’s biggest worry was getting the vaccine bottled by two subcontractors. That “fill-and-finish” work is divided between a plant in Michigan run by Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing, or GRAM, and a plant run by Catalent in Bloomington, Ind. The Biden team pushed Johnson &amp; Johnson to order GRAM to move from normal business hours to 24/7 operations, one senior administration official said. Another federal official said Johnson &amp; Johnson was largely on track but did “scale up a bit faster” under pressure.
</p>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.89189189189\" morss_score=\"28.2567567568\">
<p>
Officials also brokered an unusual partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and a longtime competitor, Merck &amp; Co. The Trump administration repeatedly explored using Merck’s plants to bolster vaccine production but never reached an agreement.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Zients, the pandemic adviser, said on Sunday that the new alliance had helped the Biden administration set its new May goal. In fact, though, Merck is likely to bottle only a few million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine by then, according to people familiar with its operation. The main benefit of the partnership will come later in the year, when Merck will have retooled a huge plant with the capacity to produce as many as 100 million doses of vaccine a month, they said.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the nuts and bolts of production, Mr. Biden’s White House has pursued a starkly different messaging campaign than Mr. Trump’s: underpromise, and then try to overdeliver. Mr. Trump routinely boasted of imminent achievements, including a vaccine rollout before Election Day, only to fall short. By contrast, health experts complained, at least initially, that Mr. Biden was overly cautious.
</p>
<p>
When the vaccine rollout began in December, Mr. Biden vowed that his administration would average one million shots a day during his first 100 days in office — enough to vaccinate 50 million people by the end of March.
</p>
<p>
After less than a week in office, he raised the goal by 50 percent, to 1.5 million shots per day. The nation passed Mr. Biden’s initial target about a month ahead of schedule and is now
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">
averaging 2.17 million doses per day
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Carefully calibrated goals “avoid losses,” said David Axelrod, the senior strategist for President Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. “Certainly they must have learned that lesson from watching Trump.”
</p>
<p>
“Internally, you drive to the highest possible goal you can make. Externally, you set a floor that you are reasonably confident you can achieve,” he said.

             The new administration’s relationship with Pfizer is markedly better. Mr. Trump and his aides had accused the company of slow-walking its vaccine development to hurt Mr. Trump’s re-election bid. The company

              announced its vaccine was robustly effective on Nov. 9

            </p>
            <p>
             Pfizer officials privately suggested that the Trump administration not only was wrongfully bad-mouthing the company but also had refused for months to invoke the Defense Production Act to order suppliers to prioritize Pfizer’s needs, as it did for the other vaccine developers under federal contract.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Biden’s aides started talking to Pfizer executives about what the company needed to make more doses even before Inauguration Day. When Mr. Biden

             on Feb. 19 to visit Pfizer’s plant, Dr. Albert Bourla, the company’s chief executive, effusively praised the new administration as “a great ally,” saying officials had helped the company secure critical materials and equipment.

             The biggest piece of locking in enough doses to cover the nation’s adults before June was Johnson &amp; Johnson. As recently as two weeks ago, Dr. Richard Nettles, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vice president for medical affairs in the United States, would say only that the company would supply 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million doses by the end of June. That fell short of its contract for 37 million doses by the end of March and 87 million by the end of May.

              reported on Tuesday
             </a>
             that Johnson &amp; Johnson had informed European Union officials that production problems might delay shipments, and Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had heard similar warnings from the company.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the United States, the company’s biggest worry was getting the vaccine bottled by two subcontractors. That “fill-and-finish” work is divided between a plant in Michigan run by Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing, or GRAM, and a plant run by Catalent in Bloomington, Ind. The Biden team pushed Johnson &amp; Johnson to order GRAM to move from normal business hours to 24/7 operations, one senior administration official said. Another federal official said Johnson &amp; Johnson was largely on track but did “scale up a bit faster” under pressure.
            </p>
           
           
          
           <div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.89189189189\" morss_score=\"28.2567567568\">
            <p>
             Officials also brokered an unusual partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and a longtime competitor, Merck &amp; Co. The Trump administration repeatedly explored using Merck’s plants to bolster vaccine production but never reached an agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Zients, the pandemic adviser, said on Sunday that the new alliance had helped the Biden administration set its new May goal. In fact, though, Merck is likely to bottle only a few million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine by then, according to people familiar with its operation. The main benefit of the partnership will come later in the year, when Merck will have retooled a huge plant with the capacity to produce as many as 100 million doses of vaccine a month, they said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beyond the nuts and bolts of production, Mr. Biden’s White House has pursued a starkly different messaging campaign than Mr. Trump’s: underpromise, and then try to overdeliver. Mr. Trump routinely boasted of imminent achievements, including a vaccine rollout before Election Day, only to fall short. By contrast, health experts complained, at least initially, that Mr. Biden was overly cautious.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the vaccine rollout began in December, Mr. Biden vowed that his administration would average one million shots a day during his first 100 days in office — enough to vaccinate 50 million people by the end of March.
            </p>
            <p>
             After less than a week in office, he raised the goal by 50 percent, to 1.5 million shots per day. The nation passed Mr. Biden’s initial target about a month ahead of schedule and is now

              averaging 2.17 million doses per day

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Carefully calibrated goals “avoid losses,” said David Axelrod, the senior strategist for President Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. “Certainly they must have learned that lesson from watching Trump.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Internally, you drive to the highest possible goal you can make. Externally, you set a floor that you are reasonably confident you can achieve,” he said.

BRUSSELS — The European Union exported 25 million doses of coronavirus vaccines produced in its territory last month to 31 countries around the world, with Britain and Canada the top destinations, just as the bloc saw its own supply cut drastically by pharmaceutical companies, slowing down vaccination efforts and stoking a political crisis at home.
</p>
<p>
The bloc — whose 27 nations are home to 450 million people — came under criticism last week, when Italy used an

block a small shipment of vaccines to Australia
</a>
. The move was criticized as protectionist, and in sharp contrast to the European Union’s mantra of free markets and global solidarity in the face of the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The issue of vaccine production and exports has also created a bitter dispute between the European Union and Britain, a recently departed member, amid accusations that the bloc wants to deprive the country of vaccine doses out of spite, in part because Britain is doing so much better with its rollout.
</p>
<p>
The tensions culminated in a diplomatic spat on Wednesday after a top E.U. official accused the United States and Britain of bringing in an “outright ban” on exports — a charge that the British government vehemently denied.
</p>
<p>
Practically speaking, ban or no ban, Britain is not exporting vaccines authorized for use at home, and the country has said it would be prepared to give excess doses to neighboring Ireland, though only after it was done with its vaccination efforts at home.
</p>
<p>
The United States has also been holding onto doses, in part through a wartime mechanism known as the Defense Production Act, which gives the federal government greater control over industrial production. President Biden promised last week that all adults in America would have at least one vaccine dose offered to them by May.
</p>
<p>
But information made public for the first time, recorded in detailed internal documents seen by The New York Times, shows that the European Union, far from being protectionist, is in fact a vaccine exporting powerhouse.

<p>
Of the 25 million vaccine doses made in E.U.-based facilities that were exported between Feb. 1 (when the export mechanism came into force) and March 1, more than eight million doses went to Britain.
</p>
<p>
And while the United States kept doses for itself, the E.U. shipped 651,000 vaccines to the United States last month and made vaccines that immunized its neighbors: The second-largest recipient of E.U.-made vaccines was Canada, which received more than three million doses last month, while the fourth-largest was Mexico, receiving nearly 2.5 million vaccine doses produced in the bloc.
</p>
<p>
Whether to reveal this data has been hotly debated in the corridors of power at the European Commission, the E.U. executive branch, which is at the heart of procuring the vaccines and has suffered the biggest political blow for the underwhelming rollout.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, several senior E.U. officials said, revealing the immense export efforts that are keeping countries around the world vaccinated and helping the world economy restart would help restore Europe’s reputation. On the other hand, it would outrage European citizens who are waiting for their shots while watching Americans, Britons, Israelis and others race past them into resuming public life, health and economic activity.
</p>
<p>
As things stand, nearly 58 percent of Israelis have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The figure is 33 percent for people in Britain, 18 percent for the United States, and 6.5 percent of people in the European Union, data collected by

<p>
The bloc was weeks behind the United States and Britain in sealing deals with pharmaceutical firms last year, but did secure a broad portfolio of vaccines on favorable terms on behalf of its members. That granted them relatively quick access to immunization that most would not have dreamed of had they been acting alone.
</p>
<p>
But within weeks of starting its rollout in late December, the bloc began suffering supply shocks. First, Pfizer said it was cutting deliveries to upgrade its facilities. Then AstraZeneca told the bloc that it would deliver only 31 million of a promised 80 million doses in the first quarter of this year.
</p>
<p>
Moderna, whose vaccine has also been approved for use by the bloc, has likewise had small problems with supply. Many E.U. countries have also done a poor job getting the vaccines they do have to their citizens because of poor organization and logistics.
</p>
<p>
The rollout in the bloc has been so poor that member states have been tempted by
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/world/desperate-eu-nations-are-hunting-for-coronavirus-vaccines-sometimes-on-a-murky-open-market.html\" title=\"\">
black-market offers of extra doses
</a>
, and several are tapping unauthorized vaccines, including Russia’s Sputnik V, which is still under review for use in the bloc.
</p>
<p>
Hopes that these woes could be eased in the second quarter of this year have largely hinged on AstraZeneca’s supply picking up and a robust delivery plan by Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose Covid-19 vaccine is set to be authorized by the E.U. regulator on Thursday.
</p>
<p>
Yet there are concerns that Johnson &amp; Johnson could also be slashing supply to the bloc, prompting a request by the bloc to the United States government for a loan of 10 million doses. Officials in the United States and the European Union said the request had been denied.

            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Practically speaking, ban or no ban, Britain is not exporting vaccines authorized for use at home, and the country has said it would be prepared to give excess doses to neighboring Ireland, though only after it was done with its vaccination efforts at home.
            </p>
            <p>
             The United States has also been holding onto doses, in part through a wartime mechanism known as the Defense Production Act, which gives the federal government greater control over industrial production. President Biden promised last week that all adults in America would have at least one vaccine dose offered to them by May.
            </p>
            <p>
             But information made public for the first time, recorded in detailed internal documents seen by The New York Times, shows that the European Union, far from being protectionist, is in fact a vaccine exporting powerhouse.

             Of the 25 million vaccine doses made in E.U.-based facilities that were exported between Feb. 1 (when the export mechanism came into force) and March 1, more than eight million doses went to Britain.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             And while the United States kept doses for itself, the E.U. shipped 651,000 vaccines to the United States last month and made vaccines that immunized its neighbors: The second-largest recipient of E.U.-made vaccines was Canada, which received more than three million doses last month, while the fourth-largest was Mexico, receiving nearly 2.5 million vaccine doses produced in the bloc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether to reveal this data has been hotly debated in the corridors of power at the European Commission, the E.U. executive branch, which is at the heart of procuring the vaccines and has suffered the biggest political blow for the underwhelming rollout.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the one hand, several senior E.U. officials said, revealing the immense export efforts that are keeping countries around the world vaccinated and helping the world economy restart would help restore Europe’s reputation. On the other hand, it would outrage European citizens who are waiting for their shots while watching Americans, Britons, Israelis and others race past them into resuming public life, health and economic activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             As things stand, nearly 58 percent of Israelis have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The figure is 33 percent for people in Britain, 18 percent for the United States, and 6.5 percent of people in the European Union, data collected by

             The bloc was weeks behind the United States and Britain in sealing deals with pharmaceutical firms last year, but did secure a broad portfolio of vaccines on favorable terms on behalf of its members. That granted them relatively quick access to immunization that most would not have dreamed of had they been acting alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             But within weeks of starting its rollout in late December, the bloc began suffering supply shocks. First, Pfizer said it was cutting deliveries to upgrade its facilities. Then AstraZeneca told the bloc that it would deliver only 31 million of a promised 80 million doses in the first quarter of this year.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Moderna, whose vaccine has also been approved for use by the bloc, has likewise had small problems with supply. Many E.U. countries have also done a poor job getting the vaccines they do have to their citizens because of poor organization and logistics.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rollout in the bloc has been so poor that member states have been tempted by
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/world/desperate-eu-nations-are-hunting-for-coronavirus-vaccines-sometimes-on-a-murky-open-market.html\" title=\"\">
              black-market offers of extra doses
             </a>
             , and several are tapping unauthorized vaccines, including Russia’s Sputnik V, which is still under review for use in the bloc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hopes that these woes could be eased in the second quarter of this year have largely hinged on AstraZeneca’s supply picking up and a robust delivery plan by Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose Covid-19 vaccine is set to be authorized by the E.U. regulator on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet there are concerns that Johnson &amp; Johnson could also be slashing supply to the bloc, prompting a request by the bloc to the United States government for a loan of 10 million doses. Officials in the United States and the European Union said the request had been denied.

<p>
The House is poised to give final approval to President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package on Wednesday, a landmark moment for the new president and Democrats in Congress, who have stayed united to push through the sweeping legislation.
</p>
<p>
The vote will come seven weeks into Mr. Biden’s presidency, as the
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\" title=\"\">
growing number of vaccine doses given
</a>
to Americans offers hope that the country is on course to move beyond the worst of a pandemic that has killed
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html\" title=\"\">
more than half a million people
</a>
in the United States.
</p>
<p>
With final passage of the vast relief package, Mr. Biden will have succeeded in his first major legislative undertaking, though most likely without any support from Republicans. The vote in the House is expected around midday.
</p>
<p>
Republicans have attacked the measure as wasteful and excessive. But those arguments have yet to gain traction outside the party’s base, with 70 percent of Americans supporting the package, according to
<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/09/broad-public-support-for-coronavirus-aid-package-just-a-third-say-it-spends-too-much/\" title=\"\">
a Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday.
</a>
</p>
<p>
The bill, which
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html\" title=\"\">
cleared the Senate
</a>
on Saturday, would send direct payments of up to $1,400 to Americans and extend a $300-per-week federal unemployment benefit until early September. It would provide funding for states and local governments as well as for schools to help them reopen. The bill also contains money for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and vaccine distribution.
</p>
<p>
The legislation establishes an aggressive effort by the new president to drive down poverty, as the measure offers substantial benefits for low-income Americans, including a sizable one-year
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/child-tax-credit-stimulus.html\" title=\"\">
expansion of the child tax credit
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden is scheduled to showcase the legislation on Thursday during a prime-time television address marking one year since the virus prompted shutdowns across the country.
</p>
<p>
Republican lawmakers, however, have criticized the stimulus plan as a partisan product that lavishes federal dollars on liberal priorities unrelated to the pandemic. No Republicans voted for it when it first passed the House last month or when it cleared the Senate over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
“We could have had a bill that was a fraction of the cost of this one that could have gotten bipartisan approval and support,” said Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican.
</p>
<p>
The sharp partisan division over the package offers a preview of the political dynamics Mr. Biden will have to contend with in the coming months as he tries to advance other pieces of his agenda, including an infrastructure plan and an
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/house-democrats-biden-immigration.html\" title=\"\">
immigration overhaul
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
The bill that will go before the House on Wednesday differs in notable ways from the legislation that the chamber initially approved last month. It no longer contains an increase to the federal minimum wage, which Mr. Biden had proposed and House Democrats had included in their bill, but the Senate omitted.
</p>
<p>
The president and House Democrats also sought to increase the $300-per-week unemployment benefit to $400, but the Senate kept it at its current level and tightened income caps for receiving stimulus payments.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, House Democrats were expected to give their blessing to the legislation, even if it falls short of what progressives desired. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a member of House leadership, said on Tuesday that he was “110 percent confident” that Democrats would have the votes to pass it.

<p>
President Biden will announce on Wednesday that he intends to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 single-shot vaccine by the end of this year, with the goal of having enough on hand to vaccinate children and, if necessary, administer booster doses or reformulate the vaccine to combat emerging variants of the virus.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Biden will make the announcement during an afternoon meeting with executives from Johnson &amp; Johnson and the pharmaceutical giant Merck, according to two senior administration officials. The rival companies are partnering to ramp up production of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, in a deal brokered by the White House.
</p>
<p>
In announcing that agreement last week,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
Mr. Biden said
</a>
that the United States would now have enough vaccine available by the end of May to vaccinate every American adult — roughly 260 million people. But the senior officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the president’s announcement, said the administration was trying to prepare for unpredictable challenges, from the emergence of dangerous virus variants to manufacturing breakdowns that could disrupt vaccine production.
</p>
<p>
The officials said that they expected the doses to be delivered sometime in the second half of this year, but could not be more specific. They said Mr. Biden would direct officials at the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate the details with Johnson &amp; Johnson, and that Wednesday’s announcement would be a first step.
</p>
<p>
The White House had initially intended to hold Wednesday’s event at the Baltimore manufacturing facility of Emergent BioSolutions, another company that partners with Johnson &amp; Johnson to make coronavirus vaccine. But
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/politics/biden-emergent-coronavirus-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
Mr. Biden canceled his trip
</a>
after The New York Times published
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/emergent-biosolutions-anthrax-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">
an investigation
</a>
into how Emergent used its Washington connections to gain outsize influence over the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s emergency repository of drugs and medical supplies.
</p>
<p>
The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has since said that the administration will conduct a comprehensive audit of the stockpile.
</p>
<p>
Emergent officials will not attend Wednesday’s session. In explaining the change in plans, Ms. Psaki said that the administration thought the White House was a “more appropriate place to have the meeting,” which it is billing as a celebration of what Mr. Biden has called the “historic” partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/02/biden-administration-announces-historic-manufacturing-collaboration-between-merck-johnson-johnson-expand-production-covid-19-vaccines.html\" title=\"\">
administration says
</a>
the collaboration will increase manufacture of the vaccine itself, and will also bolster Johnson &amp; Johnson’s packaging capacity, known in the vaccine industry as “fill-finish” — two big bottlenecks that have put the company behind schedule.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday’s announcement is in keeping with Mr. Biden’s aggressive efforts to acquire as much vaccine supply as possible, as quickly as possible. Before Mr. Biden took office, he pledged to get
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
“100 million shots into the arms”
</a>
of the American people by his 100th day in office — a timetable that seemed aggressive at the time, but more recently has looked tame. He has been trying to speed it up ever since.
</p>
<p>
At the time, two vaccines — one made by Moderna and the other by Pfizer-BioNTech — had been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use.
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-vaccines.html\" title=\"\">
In January, Mr. Biden said
</a>
the administration would have enough vaccine to cover every American by the end of summer. Last month, the president announced his administration had secured enough doses from those two companies to have enough to cover every American
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/16/world/covid-19-coronavirus/biden-suggests-vaccines-will-be-available-for-every-american-by-the-end-of-july\" title=\"\">
by the end of July
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
The recent addition of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which received emergency authorization in late February, opened a path for the administration to move up the timetable yet again. But Johnson &amp; Johnson and its other partners, including Emergent, were behind schedule, which prompted the administration to reach out to Merck.

The Pentagon announced Tuesday evening that more than 2,200 National Guard troops would remain in Washington for at least 10 more weeks to assist federal law enforcement agencies in protecting Congress, continuing a deployment that began during the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald J. Trump.
</p>
<p>
Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said Guard troops would remain on Capitol Hill through May 23, approving a request from U.S. Capitol Police to extend a deployment that had been set to expire on Friday.
</p>
<p>
“This decision was made after a thorough review of the request and after close consideration of its potential impact on readiness,” John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. He noted that the number of soldiers that would remain in the Capitol under the new agreement was approximately half of the contingent currently serving there.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Kirby said that the Defense Department would work with the Capitol Police to further reduce the number of Guard personnel guarding Congress “as conditions allow.”
</p>
<p>
The acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda D. Pittman,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/us/politics/capitol-national-guard.html\" title=\"\">
formally asked
</a>
the Defense Department on Thursday to keep thousands of National Guard troops on Capitol Hill beyond their scheduled departure. She
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/us/politics/capitol-national-guard.html\" title=\"\">
cited
</a>
a 93 percent increase in threats against lawmakers during January and February compared to the same period last year as part of the reason for requesting the extension.
</p>
<p>
Last week, House leaders canceled a session on March 4 in response to warnings from federal officials that militia groups inspired by
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-qanon.html\" title=\"\">
the pro-Trump conspiracy theory known as QAnon
</a>
might try to attack the Capitol that day. No such assault materialized.

The moment Chuck Schumer achieved his longtime dream of becoming Senate majority leader, he was in a secure room hiding from a violent pro-Trump mob that was rampaging through the Capitol.
</p>
<p>
As rioters prowled the halls hunting for top lawmakers — Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, later heard that one had been looking for his desk, saying, “Where’s the big Jew?” — he was being evacuated with other leaders to a safe room at an undisclosed location.
</p>
<p>
It was then that news outlets confirmed that Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had won the final Georgia Senate race that would give the party the majority,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/politics/democrats-senate.html\" title=\"\">
handing Mr. Schumer the top job
</a>
. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, turned to the man who had engineered his defeat and offered a brief concession and congratulations.
</p>
<p>
With that, Charles Ellis Schumer, 70, the Brooklyn-raised son of an exterminator and a homemaker, became the
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/nyregion/chuck-schumer-majority-leader.html\" title=\"\">
first New Yorker ever to lead the United States Senate
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
“Jan. 6 was the best of times,” Mr. Schumer said in a recent interview in his office, where he cracked open a Diet Coke. “And it was the worst of times.”
</p>
<p>
His dream job has come with huge challenges and a practically nonexistent margin for error. Mr. Schumer rose to power on the strength of his skills as a party messenger and relentless campaign strategist, not his talent as a legislative tactician.
</p>
<p>
Now it falls to him to maneuver President Biden’s ambitious agenda through a polarized, 50-50 Senate without one vote to spare, navigating between the progressive and moderate factions in his party in the face of a Republican opposition that is more determined than ever.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Schumer passed his first test over the weekend, squeezing Mr. Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus measure through the Senate along party lines — an effort that nearly fell apart as
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/us/politics/joe-manchin-senate.html\" title=\"\">
Senator Joe Manchin III
</a>
, Democrat of West Virginia and a crucial moderate, balked at the 11th hour. Mr. Schumer negotiated a concession, and the bill passed, paving the way for
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html\" title=\"\">
emergency aid and the most far-reaching antipoverty effort
</a>
in a generation.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Schumer.
</p>
<p>
The effort forced the Senate leader to straddle his party’s centrist and progressive wings, a trick he will have to master if he hopes to keep the president’s agenda on track and Democrats in control of the chamber, as well as fending off a possible 2024 primary challenge from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile progressive from the Bronx.
</p>
<p>
Asked what he would do about her, Mr. Schumer shrugged and said he talked to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez “all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“What I’ve done throughout my career,” he added. “I do my job well, and everything works out.”

<p>
The House Democratic campaign arm on Tuesday reversed a policy preventing consultants who have aided primary challenges against Democratic incumbents from receiving party money in the future, in a victory for the party’s insurgent progressive wing.
</p>
<p>
Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who took over this year as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had previously said that he intended to overturn the policy, which was put in place after the 2018 campaign season that saw the successful challenges of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s and Ayanna Pressley’s to longtime Democratic incumbents.
</p>
<p>
Chris Taylor, a spokesman for Mr. Maloney, said in a statement on Tuesday that the committee was opening its doors to a diverse array of consultants. “This policy change means that the only criteria for a vendor to be listed in the directory are our standards for fair business practices related to use of organized labor, critical diversity and inclusion standards and other minimum qualifications,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Waleed Shahid — a spokesman for Justice Democrats, an insurgent group that grew out of Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign and supported Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Pressley in 2018 — celebrated the move. Mr. Shahid said that the ban on challenger consultants had served to keep out progressive consultants.
</p>
<p>
It is a long-held custom for parties to protect their incumbents, and the D.C.C.C. had for years wielded an unofficial policy of not doing business with consultants or political groups that had supported a challenger against an incumbent House Democrat. But in 2018, the party’s leaders made that policy official at a moment when the progressive wing was gaining clout — and growing more savvy.
</p>
<p>
Soon after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/nyregion/joseph-crowley-ocasio-cortez-democratic-primary.html\" title=\"\">
upset Representative Joseph Crowley
</a>
in a landslide that year, partly thanks to the work of a few nimble and innovative technology consultants, the committee codified its longstanding de facto policy.
</p>
<p>
That drew fire from many left-leaning Democrats, and some worried that it would put a chill on challenges by women and people of color like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Pressley.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Shahid argued that the party was harming itself by disallowing the work of certain consultants in any of its campaigns. “That happened to some of the best digital vendors in the country,” he said. “They work on a lot of progressive primary campaigns, and they can’t work for the party’s handpicked candidates.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Shahid added that he was heartened by Mr. Maloney’s decision to reverse the ban, but that he was still waiting to see if the organization would return to its de facto policy of rejecting consultants who help challengers.
</p>
<p>
“I would hate to see the D.C.C.C. go back to an informal blacklist, which is what their policy used to be,” he said. “But it is a step forward to not have an explicit blacklist.”

<p>
President Biden’s nominees to fill out the Justice Department’s leadership ranks pledged at their confirmation hearing on Tuesday to tackle domestic extremism, racial inequality and other thorny issues within the bounds of the law, seeking to restore order to a department battered by political attacks during the Trump administration.
</p>
<p>
Lisa Monaco, a Justice Department veteran and national security expert nominated to be deputy attorney general, and Vanita Gupta, a civil rights lawyer known for her criminal justice overhaul work tapped as the department’s No. 3, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that they were committed to ensuring that the department meted out equal justice under the law.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Monaco, 53, who if confirmed would oversee the department’s day-to-day operations, the nation’s federal prosecutors and the F.B.I., said in her opening testimony that as “an independent investigator and prosecutor,” it was important that the department “act free from any political or partisan influence.”
</p>
<p>
“Throughout my career, these norms have been my North Star,” Ms. Monaco said.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Gupta, 46, who was nominated to be the associate attorney general, would oversee prosecutors who argue for the Biden administration in court, officials who allocate federal grant money to state and local governments, and federal law enforcement organizations. She would also oversee the department’s Civil Rights Division, which she ran under the Obama administration.
</p>
<p>
“We will follow the president’s policy agenda so long as it’s consistent with the law,” Ms. Gupta said.
</p>
<p>
Republicans on the committee reserved their sharpest questions for Ms. Gupta, who was a vocal critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, judicial appointments and civil rights work.
</p>
<p>
Republicans also pressed Ms. Gupta on policing, sometimes echoing a conservative attack ad that claimed she supported defunding the police. She said that was not her position, adding that she supported Mr. Biden’s commitment to provide an additional $300 million for community policing initiatives.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t support defunding the police,” Ms. Gupta said. “I have advocated for greater police resources.” She has the
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/politics/vanita-gupta-justice-department.html\" title=\"\">
backing of dozens of police organizations
</a>
and high-profile conservative groups, including Koch Industries, for her bipartisan efforts to enact criminal justice overhauls.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Gupta was also questioned about past comments about implicit bias; she said everyone, including herself, has biases that must be managed to ensure more fairness in the workplace and other institutional settings. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, asked her whom she was biased against.
</p>
<p>
Declining to name a specific group, Ms. Gupta said: “I know that I hold stereotypes that I have to manage. I’m a product of my culture.”

          The House is poised to give final approval to President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package on Wednesday, a landmark moment for the new president and Democrats in Congress, who have stayed united to push through the sweeping legislation.
         </p>
         <p>
          The vote will come seven weeks into Mr. Biden’s presidency, as the

          in the United States.
         </p>
         <p>
          With final passage of the vast relief package, Mr. Biden will have succeeded in his first major legislative undertaking, though most likely without any support from Republicans. The vote in the House is expected around midday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Republicans have attacked the measure as wasteful and excessive. But those arguments have yet to gain traction outside the party’s base, with 70 percent of Americans supporting the package, according to
          <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/09/broad-public-support-for-coronavirus-aid-package-just-a-third-say-it-spends-too-much/\" title=\"\">

         </p>
         <p>
          The bill, which
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html\" title=\"\">
           cleared the Senate
          </a>
          on Saturday, would send direct payments of up to $1,400 to Americans and extend a $300-per-week federal unemployment benefit until early September. It would provide funding for states and local governments as well as for schools to help them reopen. The bill also contains money for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and vaccine distribution.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
          The legislation establishes an aggressive effort by the new president to drive down poverty, as the measure offers substantial benefits for low-income Americans, including a sizable one-year
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/child-tax-credit-stimulus.html\" title=\"\">
           expansion of the child tax credit
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          “It’s a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden is scheduled to showcase the legislation on Thursday during a prime-time television address marking one year since the virus prompted shutdowns across the country.
         </p>
         <p>
          Republican lawmakers, however, have criticized the stimulus plan as a partisan product that lavishes federal dollars on liberal priorities unrelated to the pandemic. No Republicans voted for it when it first passed the House last month or when it cleared the Senate over the weekend.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We could have had a bill that was a fraction of the cost of this one that could have gotten bipartisan approval and support,” said Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican.
         </p>
         <p>
          The sharp partisan division over the package offers a preview of the political dynamics Mr. Biden will have to contend with in the coming months as he tries to advance other pieces of his agenda, including an infrastructure plan and an
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/house-democrats-biden-immigration.html\" title=\"\">
           immigration overhaul
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill that will go before the House on Wednesday differs in notable ways from the legislation that the chamber initially approved last month. It no longer contains an increase to the federal minimum wage, which Mr. Biden had proposed and House Democrats had included in their bill, but the Senate omitted.
         </p>
         <p>
          The president and House Democrats also sought to increase the $300-per-week unemployment benefit to $400, but the Senate kept it at its current level and tightened income caps for receiving stimulus payments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nevertheless, House Democrats were expected to give their blessing to the legislation, even if it falls short of what progressives desired. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a member of House leadership, said on Tuesday that he was “110 percent confident” that Democrats would have the votes to pass it.

          President Biden will announce on Wednesday that he intends to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 single-shot vaccine by the end of this year, with the goal of having enough on hand to vaccinate children and, if necessary, administer booster doses or reformulate the vaccine to combat emerging variants of the virus.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Biden will make the announcement during an afternoon meeting with executives from Johnson &amp; Johnson and the pharmaceutical giant Merck, according to two senior administration officials. The rival companies are partnering to ramp up production of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, in a deal brokered by the White House.
         </p>
         <p>
          In announcing that agreement last week,
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
           Mr. Biden said
          </a>
          that the United States would now have enough vaccine available by the end of May to vaccinate every American adult — roughly 260 million people. But the senior officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the president’s announcement, said the administration was trying to prepare for unpredictable challenges, from the emergence of dangerous virus variants to manufacturing breakdowns that could disrupt vaccine production.
         </p>
         <p>
          The officials said that they expected the doses to be delivered sometime in the second half of this year, but could not be more specific. They said Mr. Biden would direct officials at the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate the details with Johnson &amp; Johnson, and that Wednesday’s announcement would be a first step.
         </p>
         <p>
          The White House had initially intended to hold Wednesday’s event at the Baltimore manufacturing facility of Emergent BioSolutions, another company that partners with Johnson &amp; Johnson to make coronavirus vaccine. But

           Mr. Biden canceled his trip
          </a>

           an investigation
          </a>
          into how Emergent used its Washington connections to gain outsize influence over the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s emergency repository of drugs and medical supplies.
         </p>
         <p>
          The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has since said that the administration will conduct a comprehensive audit of the stockpile.
         </p>
         <p>
          Emergent officials will not attend Wednesday’s session. In explaining the change in plans, Ms. Psaki said that the administration thought the White House was a “more appropriate place to have the meeting,” which it is billing as a celebration of what Mr. Biden has called the “historic” partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck.

           administration says
          </a>
          the collaboration will increase manufacture of the vaccine itself, and will also bolster Johnson &amp; Johnson’s packaging capacity, known in the vaccine industry as “fill-finish” — two big bottlenecks that have put the company behind schedule.
         </p>
         <p>
          Wednesday’s announcement is in keeping with Mr. Biden’s aggressive efforts to acquire as much vaccine supply as possible, as quickly as possible. Before Mr. Biden took office, he pledged to get
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
           “100 million shots into the arms”
          </a>
          of the American people by his 100th day in office — a timetable that seemed aggressive at the time, but more recently has looked tame. He has been trying to speed it up ever since.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the time, two vaccines — one made by Moderna and the other by Pfizer-BioNTech — had been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use.
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-vaccines.html\" title=\"\">
           In January, Mr. Biden said
          </a>
          the administration would have enough vaccine to cover every American by the end of summer. Last month, the president announced his administration had secured enough doses from those two companies to have enough to cover every American

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The recent addition of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which received emergency authorization in late February, opened a path for the administration to move up the timetable yet again. But Johnson &amp; Johnson and its other partners, including Emergent, were behind schedule, which prompted the administration to reach out to Merck.

          The Pentagon announced Tuesday evening that more than 2,200 National Guard troops would remain in Washington for at least 10 more weeks to assist federal law enforcement agencies in protecting Congress, continuing a deployment that began during the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald J. Trump.
         </p>
         <p>
          Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said Guard troops would remain on Capitol Hill through May 23, approving a request from U.S. Capitol Police to extend a deployment that had been set to expire on Friday.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This decision was made after a thorough review of the request and after close consideration of its potential impact on readiness,” John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. He noted that the number of soldiers that would remain in the Capitol under the new agreement was approximately half of the contingent currently serving there.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Kirby said that the Defense Department would work with the Capitol Police to further reduce the number of Guard personnel guarding Congress “as conditions allow.”

          The moment Chuck Schumer achieved his longtime dream of becoming Senate majority leader, he was in a secure room hiding from a violent pro-Trump mob that was rampaging through the Capitol.
         </p>
         <p>
          As rioters prowled the halls hunting for top lawmakers — Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, later heard that one had been looking for his desk, saying, “Where’s the big Jew?” — he was being evacuated with other leaders to a safe room at an undisclosed location.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was then that news outlets confirmed that Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had won the final Georgia Senate race that would give the party the majority,
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/politics/democrats-senate.html\" title=\"\">
           handing Mr. Schumer the top job
          </a>
          . Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, turned to the man who had engineered his defeat and offered a brief concession and congratulations.
         </p>
         <p>
          With that, Charles Ellis Schumer, 70, the Brooklyn-raised son of an exterminator and a homemaker, became the
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/nyregion/chuck-schumer-majority-leader.html\" title=\"\">
           first New Yorker ever to lead the United States Senate
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          “Jan. 6 was the best of times,” Mr. Schumer said in a recent interview in his office, where he cracked open a Diet Coke. “And it was the worst of times.”
         </p>
         <p>
          His dream job has come with huge challenges and a practically nonexistent margin for error. Mr. Schumer rose to power on the strength of his skills as a party messenger and relentless campaign strategist, not his talent as a legislative tactician.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now it falls to him to maneuver President Biden’s ambitious agenda through a polarized, 50-50 Senate without one vote to spare, navigating between the progressive and moderate factions in his party in the face of a Republican opposition that is more determined than ever.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Schumer passed his first test over the weekend, squeezing Mr. Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus measure through the Senate along party lines — an effort that nearly fell apart as
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/us/politics/joe-manchin-senate.html\" title=\"\">
           Senator Joe Manchin III
          </a>
          , Democrat of West Virginia and a crucial moderate, balked at the 11th hour. Mr. Schumer negotiated a concession, and the bill passed, paving the way for
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html\" title=\"\">
           emergency aid and the most far-reaching antipoverty effort
          </a>
          in a generation.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’ve never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Schumer.
         </p>
         <p>
          The effort forced the Senate leader to straddle his party’s centrist and progressive wings, a trick he will have to master if he hopes to keep the president’s agenda on track and Democrats in control of the chamber, as well as fending off a possible 2024 primary challenge from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile progressive from the Bronx.
         </p>
         <p>
          Asked what he would do about her, Mr. Schumer shrugged and said he talked to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez “all the time.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “What I’ve done throughout my career,” he added. “I do my job well, and everything works out.”

          The House Democratic campaign arm on Tuesday reversed a policy preventing consultants who have aided primary challenges against Democratic incumbents from receiving party money in the future, in a victory for the party’s insurgent progressive wing.
         </p>
         <p>
          Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who took over this year as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had previously said that he intended to overturn the policy, which was put in place after the 2018 campaign season that saw the successful challenges of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s and Ayanna Pressley’s to longtime Democratic incumbents.
         </p>
         <p>
          Chris Taylor, a spokesman for Mr. Maloney, said in a statement on Tuesday that the committee was opening its doors to a diverse array of consultants. “This policy change means that the only criteria for a vendor to be listed in the directory are our standards for fair business practices related to use of organized labor, critical diversity and inclusion standards and other minimum qualifications,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Waleed Shahid — a spokesman for Justice Democrats, an insurgent group that grew out of Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign and supported Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Pressley in 2018 — celebrated the move. Mr. Shahid said that the ban on challenger consultants had served to keep out progressive consultants.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is a long-held custom for parties to protect their incumbents, and the D.C.C.C. had for years wielded an unofficial policy of not doing business with consultants or political groups that had supported a challenger against an incumbent House Democrat. But in 2018, the party’s leaders made that policy official at a moment when the progressive wing was gaining clout — and growing more savvy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Soon after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/nyregion/joseph-crowley-ocasio-cortez-democratic-primary.html\" title=\"\">
           upset Representative Joseph Crowley
          </a>
          in a landslide that year, partly thanks to the work of a few nimble and innovative technology consultants, the committee codified its longstanding de facto policy.
         </p>
         <p>
          That drew fire from many left-leaning Democrats, and some worried that it would put a chill on challenges by women and people of color like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Pressley.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Shahid argued that the party was harming itself by disallowing the work of certain consultants in any of its campaigns. “That happened to some of the best digital vendors in the country,” he said. “They work on a lot of progressive primary campaigns, and they can’t work for the party’s handpicked candidates.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Shahid added that he was heartened by Mr. Maloney’s decision to reverse the ban, but that he was still waiting to see if the organization would return to its de facto policy of rejecting consultants who help challengers.

          President Biden’s nominees to fill out the Justice Department’s leadership ranks pledged at their confirmation hearing on Tuesday to tackle domestic extremism, racial inequality and other thorny issues within the bounds of the law, seeking to restore order to a department battered by political attacks during the Trump administration.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lisa Monaco, a Justice Department veteran and national security expert nominated to be deputy attorney general, and Vanita Gupta, a civil rights lawyer known for her criminal justice overhaul work tapped as the department’s No. 3, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that they were committed to ensuring that the department meted out equal justice under the law.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Monaco, 53, who if confirmed would oversee the department’s day-to-day operations, the nation’s federal prosecutors and the F.B.I., said in her opening testimony that as “an independent investigator and prosecutor,” it was important that the department “act free from any political or partisan influence.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “Throughout my career, these norms have been my North Star,” Ms. Monaco said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Gupta, 46, who was nominated to be the associate attorney general, would oversee prosecutors who argue for the Biden administration in court, officials who allocate federal grant money to state and local governments, and federal law enforcement organizations. She would also oversee the department’s Civil Rights Division, which she ran under the Obama administration.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We will follow the president’s policy agenda so long as it’s consistent with the law,” Ms. Gupta said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Republicans on the committee reserved their sharpest questions for Ms. Gupta, who was a vocal critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, judicial appointments and civil rights work.
         </p>
         <p>
          Republicans also pressed Ms. Gupta on policing, sometimes echoing a conservative attack ad that claimed she supported defunding the police. She said that was not her position, adding that she supported Mr. Biden’s commitment to provide an additional $300 million for community policing initiatives.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I don’t support defunding the police,” Ms. Gupta said. “I have advocated for greater police resources.” She has the
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/us/politics/vanita-gupta-justice-department.html\" title=\"\">
           backing of dozens of police organizations
          </a>
          and high-profile conservative groups, including Koch Industries, for her bipartisan efforts to enact criminal justice overhauls.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Gupta was also questioned about past comments about implicit bias; she said everyone, including herself, has biases that must be managed to ensure more fairness in the workplace and other institutional settings. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, asked her whom she was biased against.
         </p>
         <p>
          Declining to name a specific group, Ms. Gupta said: “I know that I hold stereotypes that I have to manage. I’m a product of my culture.”

Inflation rose modestly in February, nudged by an increase in gasoline prices that lifted the overall Consumer Price Index by 0.4 percent.
</p>
<p>
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories,
<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">
the index rose by 0.1 percent
</a>
, the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning. With the prospect of faster economic growth on the horizon, investors and market watchers have been paying close attention to the threat of heightened inflation, although it has yet to materialize for the most part.
</p>
<p>
The imminent passage of the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package has intensified those worries, with some concerned that the money will pour fuel on an economy that is already poised to heat up as businesses reopen this spring and the pandemic recedes in the face of widespread vaccinations.
</p>
<p>
Gasoline prices alone were up 6.4 percent in February. But over all, the data matched expectations, suggesting inflation remains under control, despite a recent rise in prices for commodities like oil and copper.
</p>
<p>
“Outside of another buoyant advance in energy prices in February, consumer price inflation remains very tame,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.
</p>
<p>
Over the long term, inflation is a concern because it erodes the value of assets, especially stocks and bonds. An uptick in bond yields in recent weeks, which correlate with inflation fears, helped prompt a sell-off on Wall Street, particularly among high-flying tech stocks.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, once inflation becomes entrenched it can be hard to subdue, reawakening memories of the 1970s, when rampant inflation haunted the American economy.
</p>
<p>
But conditions are far different than they were back then, and most mainstream economists doubt a sustained bout of inflation is on its way. The Federal Reserve, which is committed to preserving price stability, has signaled that it intends to maintain its support for the economy and not tighten monetary policy anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
“The inflation narrative has switched to concerns about rising prices,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “For the Fed, price response to the economy reopening is seen as transitory and is unlikely to cause too much angst, given inflation pressures are not expected to be sustained.”

and expectations about where it will go next. After years of very low inflation, some economists and investors argue that too much fiscal stimulus during the recovery from the pandemic could cause the economy to overheat and send prices surging. But many central bankers say there are long-term disinflationary forces and an increase in inflation is likely to be temporary.

General Electric said on Wednesday that it would sell its airplane leasing unit to a rival, AerCap, in a deal that would reshape an aviation industry already transformed by the coronavirus pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The deal, valued at $30 billion, would combine the world’s two largest aircraft leasing companies, creating a behemoth that owns or manages about one out of every six leased planes globally,
<a href=\"https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/cirium-aviation-experts-review-gecas-aercap-merger/?cmpid=soc%7Cfinance%7C2021-03-08-gecas-aercap-merger&amp;sf243754523=1\" title=\"\">
according to Cirium, an aviation data firm
</a>
. If the sale is approved, the combined company will have about 300 customers globally and more than 2,000 aircraft in its portfolio,
<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aercap-to-acquire-ge-capital-aviation-services-301244404.html\" title=\"\">
AerCap said in a statement
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
The sale of the unit, GE Capital Aviation Services, could give the new business even more negotiating power over aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus as well as the airlines to which AerCap and G.E. lease planes. It would also advance G.E.’s yearslong effort to simplify its business and reduce debt.
</p>
<p>
For years, G.E. has been focusing on its core industrial businesses and moving away from the financing activities of its G.E. Capital unit, which included the plane leasing arm. From the end of 2018 to the end of 2020, the value of G.E. Capital’s assets shrank from $86 billion to $68 billion. If the sale to AerCap goes through, the finance arm would go down to $21 billion.
</p>
<p>
“I hope what you see here this morning is a truly tremendous catalyst in the journey that we’re on to transform G.E.,” the company’s chairman and chief executive, H. Lawrence Culp Jr., said in a conference call with investors and analysts.
</p>
<p>
If the sale is approved, G.E. will also have reduced its debt by more than $70 billion since the end of 2018, G.E.’s chief financial officer, Carolina Dybeck Happe, said on the call.
</p>
<p>
Under the terms of the deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, G.E. will receive more than 111 million AerCap shares, $24 billion in cash and $1 billion of AerCap notes or cash. The transaction is expected to close in nine to 12 months, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.
</p>
<p>
G.E. is expected to own about 46 percent of the combined company and will be entitled to nominate two directors to the board of AerCap, which is based in Dublin.

at a refinery in Minnesota. And unions have had an often tense relationship with activist hedge funds like Elliott, which they have accused of calling for layoffs that affect union members. (In its letter to the F.T.C., the Teamsters union criticized what it called “Elliott’s singular desire to liquidate Marathon’s assets to fund enormous share buybacks and special dividends.”)
</p>
<p>
But the agency is already far along in its review. Marathon executives, who hope to close the deal by the end of the first quarter, confirmed on a call with analysts last month that they had responded to a second request for information from the F.T.C. and were working on solutions. (The proposed buyer of Speedway, Seven and I Holdings, is

reportedly looking to sell
</a>
up to 300 gas stations to ease the agency’s concerns.)
</p>
<p>
The F.T.C. must follow statutory timelines for reviewing deals, which means the agency can delay its examination only for so long, even if it wanted to. And it’s not clear whether Ms. Klobuchar’s bill will pass, or in what form.

Partners of McKinsey &amp; Company
<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/media/press-release-bob-sternfels\" title=\"\">
chose Bob Sternfels
</a>
as their new global managing partner, the consulting giant said on Wednesday, as it seeks to recover from a series of scandals that damaged its reputation in recent years.
</p>
<p>
The election of Mr. Sternfels, 51, comes weeks after McKinsey partners effectively
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/business/mckinsey-kevin-sneader.html\" title=\"\">
voted out Kevin Sneader
</a>
from the firm’s top role. The ousting of Mr. Sneader, who did not make the final ballot of the election, was the first time a McKinsey leader had been denied re-election in decades.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Sneader took the top role in 2018, he was confronted with controversy over the firm’s role advising a South African state-owned power company, and later criticism over its work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and over conflicts of interest in its bankruptcy practice.
</p>
<p>
Now Mr. Sternfels will inherit blowback from the consultancy’s agreement to
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/business/mckinsey-opioids-settlement.html\" title=\"\">
pay nearly $600 million
</a>
to settle an investigation into its role in the opioid crisis. The settlement with 49 states and the District of Columbia centered on McKinsey’s work advising drug makers on how to “turbocharge” opioid sales.
</p>
<p>
Other recent controversies include the firm’s work
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/france-mckinsey-consultants-covid-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
advising the French government
</a>
on its coronavirus vaccine rollout, which has been derided for being too slow.
</p>
<p>
Among the most pressing internal priorities facing Mr. Sternfels is how to tighten oversight of a 650-member partnership that has traditionally operated with significant autonomy — and sometimes resisted efforts to impose more centralized authority.
</p>
<p>
A 26-year McKinsey veteran based in San Francisco, Mr. Sternfels leads the firm’s client capabilities operations. He beat out Sven Smit, a partner based in Amsterdam who is co-chairman of the McKinsey Global Institute, its research division.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Sternfels said in a statement that he was “committed to build on the important changes that Kevin helped launch and our partnership embraced — and on the good work our firm does with our clients and in society.”

<p>
HOUSTON — Orders requiring masks and limiting the occupancy of restaurants and other businesses were lifted across Texas on Wednesday, a move that some medical experts said was premature while the state was still in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Businesses are still allowed to require employees and customers to cover their faces and limit the number of people they allow inside. Cities can choose to keep limits in place in municipal facilities, and they remain on federal property.
</p>
<p>
When
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/coronavirus-reopening-texas.html\" title=\"\">
Gov. Greg Abbott announced the changes last week
</a>
, he argued that he was pushing back against the economic devastation wrought by months of limitations on movement and commerce. In a news conference at a restaurant in Lubbock, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, noted the hindrances for workers and small businesses.
</p>
<p>
“This must end,” he said. “It is now time to open Texas 100 percent.”
</p>
<p>
Moments after Mr. Abbott’s announcement, patrons at Barflys in San Antonio removed the plexiglass dividers separating themselves from the bartenders.
</p>
<p>
At Barflys on Tuesday, an hour before the mask mandate was to expire, Amber Jowers, 32, was the bartender on duty. She welcomed the policy change. From now on, she will no longer wear a mask at work, she said.
</p>
<p>
“And we’re taking the sign down at midnight,” she added. “We have to get back to normal now.”
</p>
<p>
Barflys is a softly lit pub with a pool table, dartboard, and a slot machine. Metallica, Salt-N-Pepa, and the Texas Tornados play from the sound system.
</p>
<p>
On the smokey back patio, Sophie Bojorquez, 47, sat at a table with friends. She is a vaccinated nurse and a self-proclaimed anti-masker.
</p>
<p>
“I’m happy about the governor’s decision. The masks impeded the herd immunity we need. Now they want to vax so fast,” she said, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
The patio bartender, Britt Harasmisz, 24, said that most of her customers didn’t wear a mask even before the mandate ended. And though her employer decided that Barflys would no longer require face covers, she said that she would continue to wear one while working.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of people have been vaccinated, Governor Abbott was vaccinated, but a lot of us on the front lines have not,” she said. “I’m going to wear a mask everywhere I go.”
</p>
<p>
The move to open Texas has faced intense resistance. The governor’s medical advisers have said that they were not involved in the decision. And some experts have raised concerns about intensifying the spread of the virus while the vaccination process is underway. Texas, which is
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html\" title=\"\">
averaging about 5,500 new cases
</a>
a day, has one of the
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\" title=\"\">
lowest vaccination rates
</a>
in the country.
</p>
<p>
Lina Hidalgo, the county judge in Harris County, which includes Houston, has argued that lifting the mask mandate means workers must be the ones to enforce rules in retail establishments and restaurants.
</p>
<p>
“We know better than to let our guard down simply because a level of government selected an arbitrary date to issue an all-clear,” Ms. Hidalgo, a Democrat and a persistent critic of Mr. Abbott, said in an
<a href=\"https://time.com/5944818/texas-mask-mandate-reopening-lina-hidalgo/\" title=\"\">
op-ed column published this week by Time magazine
</a>
. “I am working to clearly explain to the residents of my county that we will spare ourselves unnecessary death and suffering if we just stick with it for a little bit longer.”
</p>
<p>
Bert Rossel, 39, stopped in for a drink at Barflys on Tuesday evening. He said he had known the pub’s owner for many years and worked for him at one time. Mr. Rossel is in the insurance business nowadays. He said he believed that the pandemic had been hyped on social media as another distraction, or as he calls it, “the latest hot topic.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s survival of the fittest,” Mr. Rossel said. “My B.M.I. is higher than normal. Obese people are more susceptible to corona, but it’s been over a year. I would have gotten it already.”
</p>
<p>
As the evening advanced, the patrons at Barflys drank beer and downed shots, smoked and gossiped, enjoying each other’s company. No one paid attention when, at midnight, Ms. Jowers pulled the sign from the front door that read, “MASKS REQUIRED UPON ENTRY.”

The highest ranking editor at

NewsNation, a newcomer to cable news
</a>
that markets itself as delivering “straight-ahead, unbiased news reporting,” has resigned. She is the third top editor to quit in recent months as some staff have complained of a rightward shift at the network.
</p>
<p>
Jennifer Lyons, NewsNation’s vice president of news, had decided to depart the channel, effective immediately, the company’s staff were told at a meeting on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
Sandy Pudar, the news director, left on Feb. 2, and Richard Maginn, the managing editor, resigned on March 1.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Lyons did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Texas-based Nexstar Media, which owns NewsNation, said in a statement that it was Ms. Lyons’s decision to leave and that the search for her replacement was underway.
</p>
<p>
At Tuesday’s staff meeting in Chicago, Perry A. Sook, the chief executive of Nexstar, sought to reassure staff of his commitment to NewsNation after several employees raised concerns about its editorial direction and the involvement of
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/us/politics/bill-shine-fox-news.html\" title=\"\">
Bill Shine, a former Fox News co-president

who was hired to lead communications for the Trump White House. The concerns among employees were detailed in a
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/business/media/newsnation-cable-news.html\" title=\"\">
New York Times article earlier this week.
</a>
</p>
<p>
“Despite reports to the contrary that you may read, we’re committed to the vision of unbiased reporting,” he said during the meeting, according to a recording of the comments obtained by The New York Times. “But obviously along the way there will be growing pains. In order for us to establish our product and to grow our viewership we’re going to have to try new things to gain some traction.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Sook, asked by a staff member about Mr. Shine, said he had not been in the NewsNation building and did not dictate content.
</p>
<p>
“This guy was in the room where it happened 25 years ago and helped to build the channel to where it is,” Mr. Sook said of Mr. Shine’s experience at Fox News. “Why would we not avail ourselves of his expertise?”
</p>
<p>
“NewsNation” launched on Sept. 1 as a prime-time national newscast on the cable channel WGN America. It promised an antidote to the more partisan programming of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. On March 1, WGN America was rebranded as NewsNation and more news shows were introduced.

<p>
WASHINGTON — President Biden is expected to name Lina Khan, a law professor and leading critic of the tech industry’s power, to a seat on the Federal Trade Commission, a person with knowledge of the decision said on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
An appointment of Ms. Khan, the author of a
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html\" title=\"\">
breakthrough Yale Law Journal paper
</a>
in 2016 that accused Amazon of abusing its monopoly power, would be the latest sign that the Biden administration planned to take an aggressive posture toward tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Last week,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html\" title=\"\">
the administration said Tim Wu
</a>
, another top critic of the industry, would join the National Economic Council as a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Khan recently served as legal counsel for the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee and was among aides who conducted a 19-month investigation into the tech giants’ monopoly power. The committee
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html\" title=\"\">
produced a report
</a>
advocating major changes to antitrust laws. Before that, she served as an aide to a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rohit Chopra, a champion of her ideas on antitrust policy.
</p>
<p>
Ms. Khan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School, would fill one of three Democratic seats on the five-member F.T.C. In December, the commission
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html\" title=\"\">
sued Facebook
</a>
, accusing it of antitrust violations, and called for breaking up the company. The agency is also investing Amazon for antitrust violations.
</p>
<p>
Rumors of Ms. Khan’s appointment, which were reported earlier by Politico, immediately sparked strong reactions on Tuesday. Public Citizen, a left-leaning nonprofit public advocacy group, cheered the possibility. The organization and many progressive groups have denounced the F.T.C.’s history — particularly during the Obama administration — for lax enforcement of technology companies. They argue that the federal government’s permissive attitude toward mergers by the tech giants, including Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, helped the Silicon Valley companies grow quickly and dominate their rivals.
<br>
</p>
<p>
“The F.T.C. has failed to take on corporate abuses of power including rampant antitrust violations, privacy intrusions, data security breaches and mergers, and Khan’s appointment as a commissioner at the agency hopefully will herald a new day,” Public Citizen said in a statement.
</p><p>
Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said Ms. Khan would be a bad fit for the job, however.
</p>
<p>
“Her views on antitrust enforcement are also wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law,” Mr. Lee said in a statement. “Nominating Ms. Khan would signal that President Biden intends to put ideology and politics ahead of competent antitrust enforcement, which would be gravely disappointing at a time when it is absolutely critical that we have strong and effective leadership at the enforcement agencies.”

          </a>
          , the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning. With the prospect of faster economic growth on the horizon, investors and market watchers have been paying close attention to the threat of heightened inflation, although it has yet to materialize for the most part.
         </p>
         <p>
          The imminent passage of the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package has intensified those worries, with some concerned that the money will pour fuel on an economy that is already poised to heat up as businesses reopen this spring and the pandemic recedes in the face of widespread vaccinations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Gasoline prices alone were up 6.4 percent in February. But over all, the data matched expectations, suggesting inflation remains under control, despite a recent rise in prices for commodities like oil and copper.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Outside of another buoyant advance in energy prices in February, consumer price inflation remains very tame,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over the long term, inflation is a concern because it erodes the value of assets, especially stocks and bonds. An uptick in bond yields in recent weeks, which correlate with inflation fears, helped prompt a sell-off on Wall Street, particularly among high-flying tech stocks.
         </p>
         <p>
          What’s more, once inflation becomes entrenched it can be hard to subdue, reawakening memories of the 1970s, when rampant inflation haunted the American economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          But conditions are far different than they were back then, and most mainstream economists doubt a sustained bout of inflation is on its way. The Federal Reserve, which is committed to preserving price stability, has signaled that it intends to maintain its support for the economy and not tighten monetary policy anytime soon.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The inflation narrative has switched to concerns about rising prices,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “For the Fed, price response to the economy reopening is seen as transitory and is unlikely to cause too much angst, given inflation pressures are not expected to be sustained.”

          and expectations about where it will go next. After years of very low inflation, some economists and investors argue that too much fiscal stimulus during the recovery from the pandemic could cause the economy to overheat and send prices surging. But many central bankers say there are long-term disinflationary forces and an increase in inflation is likely to be temporary.

          General Electric said on Wednesday that it would sell its airplane leasing unit to a rival, AerCap, in a deal that would reshape an aviation industry already transformed by the coronavirus pandemic.
         </p>
         <p>
          The deal, valued at $30 billion, would combine the world’s two largest aircraft leasing companies, creating a behemoth that owns or manages about one out of every six leased planes globally,
          <a href=\"https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/cirium-aviation-experts-review-gecas-aercap-merger/?cmpid=soc%7Cfinance%7C2021-03-08-gecas-aercap-merger&amp;sf243754523=1\" title=\"\">
           according to Cirium, an aviation data firm
          </a>
          . If the sale is approved, the combined company will have about 300 customers globally and more than 2,000 aircraft in its portfolio,
          <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aercap-to-acquire-ge-capital-aviation-services-301244404.html\" title=\"\">
           AerCap said in a statement
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The sale of the unit, GE Capital Aviation Services, could give the new business even more negotiating power over aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus as well as the airlines to which AerCap and G.E. lease planes. It would also advance G.E.’s yearslong effort to simplify its business and reduce debt.
         </p>
         <p>
          For years, G.E. has been focusing on its core industrial businesses and moving away from the financing activities of its G.E. Capital unit, which included the plane leasing arm. From the end of 2018 to the end of 2020, the value of G.E. Capital’s assets shrank from $86 billion to $68 billion. If the sale to AerCap goes through, the finance arm would go down to $21 billion.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I hope what you see here this morning is a truly tremendous catalyst in the journey that we’re on to transform G.E.,” the company’s chairman and chief executive, H. Lawrence Culp Jr., said in a conference call with investors and analysts.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the sale is approved, G.E. will also have reduced its debt by more than $70 billion since the end of 2018, G.E.’s chief financial officer, Carolina Dybeck Happe, said on the call.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the terms of the deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, G.E. will receive more than 111 million AerCap shares, $24 billion in cash and $1 billion of AerCap notes or cash. The transaction is expected to close in nine to 12 months, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.
         </p>
         <p>
          G.E. is expected to own about 46 percent of the combined company and will be entitled to nominate two directors to the board of AerCap, which is based in Dublin.

            Congress passes a bill by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, that would make broad changes to antitrust rules. The legislation would change the framework used by the F.T.C. to evaluate the deal, allowing the regulator to reject transactions based on the possibility

          at a refinery in Minnesota. And unions have had an often tense relationship with activist hedge funds like Elliott, which they have accused of calling for layoffs that affect union members. (In its letter to the F.T.C., the Teamsters union criticized what it called “Elliott’s singular desire to liquidate Marathon’s assets to fund enormous share buybacks and special dividends.”)

          The F.T.C. must follow statutory timelines for reviewing deals, which means the agency can delay its examination only for so long, even if it wanted to. And it’s not clear whether Ms. Klobuchar’s bill will pass, or in what form.

           chose Bob Sternfels
          </a>
          as their new global managing partner, the consulting giant said on Wednesday, as it seeks to recover from a series of scandals that damaged its reputation in recent years.
         </p>
         <p>
          The election of Mr. Sternfels, 51, comes weeks after McKinsey partners effectively
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/business/mckinsey-kevin-sneader.html\" title=\"\">
           voted out Kevin Sneader
          </a>
          from the firm’s top role. The ousting of Mr. Sneader, who did not make the final ballot of the election, was the first time a McKinsey leader had been denied re-election in decades.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Mr. Sneader took the top role in 2018, he was confronted with controversy over the firm’s role advising a South African state-owned power company, and later criticism over its work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and over conflicts of interest in its bankruptcy practice.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now Mr. Sternfels will inherit blowback from the consultancy’s agreement to
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/business/mckinsey-opioids-settlement.html\" title=\"\">
           pay nearly $600 million
          </a>
          to settle an investigation into its role in the opioid crisis. The settlement with 49 states and the District of Columbia centered on McKinsey’s work advising drug makers on how to “turbocharge” opioid sales.
         </p>
         <p>
          Other recent controversies include the firm’s work
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/france-mckinsey-consultants-covid-vaccine.html\" title=\"\">
           advising the French government
          </a>
          on its coronavirus vaccine rollout, which has been derided for being too slow.
         </p>
         <p>
          Among the most pressing internal priorities facing Mr. Sternfels is how to tighten oversight of a 650-member partnership that has traditionally operated with significant autonomy — and sometimes resisted efforts to impose more centralized authority.
         </p>
         <p>
          A 26-year McKinsey veteran based in San Francisco, Mr. Sternfels leads the firm’s client capabilities operations. He beat out Sven Smit, a partner based in Amsterdam who is co-chairman of the McKinsey Global Institute, its research division.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr. Sternfels said in a statement that he was “committed to build on the important changes that Kevin helped launch and our partnership embraced — and on the good work our firm does with our clients and in society.”

          HOUSTON — Orders requiring masks and limiting the occupancy of restaurants and other businesses were lifted across Texas on Wednesday, a move that some medical experts said was premature while the state was still in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.
         </p>
         <p>
          Businesses are still allowed to require employees and customers to cover their faces and limit the number of people they allow inside. Cities can choose to keep limits in place in municipal facilities, and they remain on federal property.
         </p>
         <p>
          When
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/coronavirus-reopening-texas.html\" title=\"\">
           Gov. Greg Abbott announced the changes last week
          </a>
          , he argued that he was pushing back against the economic devastation wrought by months of limitations on movement and commerce. In a news conference at a restaurant in Lubbock, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, noted the hindrances for workers and small businesses.
         </p>
         <p>
          “This must end,” he said. “It is now time to open Texas 100 percent.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Moments after Mr. Abbott’s announcement, patrons at Barflys in San Antonio removed the plexiglass dividers separating themselves from the bartenders.
         </p>
         <p>
          At Barflys on Tuesday, an hour before the mask mandate was to expire, Amber Jowers, 32, was the bartender on duty. She welcomed the policy change. From now on, she will no longer wear a mask at work, she said.
         </p>
         <p>
          “And we’re taking the sign down at midnight,” she added. “We have to get back to normal now.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Barflys is a softly lit pub with a pool table, dartboard, and a slot machine. Metallica, Salt-N-Pepa, and the Texas Tornados play from the sound system.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the smokey back patio, Sophie Bojorquez, 47, sat at a table with friends. She is a vaccinated nurse and a self-proclaimed anti-masker.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I’m happy about the governor’s decision. The masks impeded the herd immunity we need. Now they want to vax so fast,” she said, shaking her head.
         </p>
         <p>
          The patio bartender, Britt Harasmisz, 24, said that most of her customers didn’t wear a mask even before the mandate ended. And though her employer decided that Barflys would no longer require face covers, she said that she would continue to wear one while working.
         </p>
         <p>
          “A lot of people have been vaccinated, Governor Abbott was vaccinated, but a lot of us on the front lines have not,” she said. “I’m going to wear a mask everywhere I go.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The move to open Texas has faced intense resistance. The governor’s medical advisers have said that they were not involved in the decision. And some experts have raised concerns about intensifying the spread of the virus while the vaccination process is underway. Texas, which is
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html\" title=\"\">
           averaging about 5,500 new cases
          </a>
          a day, has one of the
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\" title=\"\">
           lowest vaccination rates
          </a>
          in the country.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lina Hidalgo, the county judge in Harris County, which includes Houston, has argued that lifting the mask mandate means workers must be the ones to enforce rules in retail establishments and restaurants.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We know better than to let our guard down simply because a level of government selected an arbitrary date to issue an all-clear,” Ms. Hidalgo, a Democrat and a persistent critic of Mr. Abbott, said in an
          <a href=\"https://time.com/5944818/texas-mask-mandate-reopening-lina-hidalgo/\" title=\"\">
           op-ed column published this week by Time magazine
          </a>
          . “I am working to clearly explain to the residents of my county that we will spare ourselves unnecessary death and suffering if we just stick with it for a little bit longer.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Bert Rossel, 39, stopped in for a drink at Barflys on Tuesday evening. He said he had known the pub’s owner for many years and worked for him at one time. Mr. Rossel is in the insurance business nowadays. He said he believed that the pandemic had been hyped on social media as another distraction, or as he calls it, “the latest hot topic.”
         </p>
         <p>
          “It’s survival of the fittest,” Mr. Rossel said. “My B.M.I. is higher than normal. Obese people are more susceptible to corona, but it’s been over a year. I would have gotten it already.”
         </p>
         <p>
          As the evening advanced, the patrons at Barflys drank beer and downed shots, smoked and gossiped, enjoying each other’s company. No one paid attention when, at midnight, Ms. Jowers pulled the sign from the front door that read, “MASKS REQUIRED UPON ENTRY.”

         </p>
         <p>
          Sandy Pudar, the news director, left on Feb. 2, and Richard Maginn, the managing editor, resigned on March 1.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Lyons did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Texas-based Nexstar Media, which owns NewsNation, said in a statement that it was Ms. Lyons’s decision to leave and that the search for her replacement was underway.
         </p>
         <p>
          At Tuesday’s staff meeting in Chicago, Perry A. Sook, the chief executive of Nexstar, sought to reassure staff of his commitment to NewsNation after several employees raised concerns about its editorial direction and the involvement of

          “NewsNation” launched on Sept. 1 as a prime-time national newscast on the cable channel WGN America. It promised an antidote to the more partisan programming of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. On March 1, WGN America was rebranded as NewsNation and more news shows were introduced.

          WASHINGTON — President Biden is expected to name Lina Khan, a law professor and leading critic of the tech industry’s power, to a seat on the Federal Trade Commission, a person with knowledge of the decision said on Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          An appointment of Ms. Khan, the author of a
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html\" title=\"\">
           breakthrough Yale Law Journal paper
          </a>
          in 2016 that accused Amazon of abusing its monopoly power, would be the latest sign that the Biden administration planned to take an aggressive posture toward tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Last week,
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html\" title=\"\">
           the administration said Tim Wu
          </a>
          , another top critic of the industry, would join the National Economic Council as a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Khan recently served as legal counsel for the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee and was among aides who conducted a 19-month investigation into the tech giants’ monopoly power. The committee
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html\" title=\"\">
           produced a report
          </a>
          advocating major changes to antitrust laws. Before that, she served as an aide to a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rohit Chopra, a champion of her ideas on antitrust policy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms. Khan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School, would fill one of three Democratic seats on the five-member F.T.C. In December, the commission
          <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html\" title=\"\">
           sued Facebook
          </a>
          , accusing it of antitrust violations, and called for breaking up the company. The agency is also investing Amazon for antitrust violations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rumors of Ms. Khan’s appointment, which were reported earlier by Politico, immediately sparked strong reactions on Tuesday. Public Citizen, a left-leaning nonprofit public advocacy group, cheered the possibility. The organization and many progressive groups have denounced the F.T.C.’s history — particularly during the Obama administration — for lax enforcement of technology companies. They argue that the federal government’s permissive attitude toward mergers by the tech giants, including Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, helped the Silicon Valley companies grow quickly and dominate their rivals.
          <br>
          </p>
         <p>
          “The F.T.C. has failed to take on corporate abuses of power including rampant antitrust violations, privacy intrusions, data security breaches and mergers, and Khan’s appointment as a commissioner at the agency hopefully will herald a new day,” Public Citizen said in a statement.
         </p><p>
          Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said Ms. Khan would be a bad fit for the job, however.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Her views on antitrust enforcement are also wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law,” Mr. Lee said in a statement. “Nominating Ms. Khan would signal that President Biden intends to put ideology and politics ahead of competent antitrust enforcement, which would be gravely disappointing at a time when it is absolutely critical that we have strong and effective leadership at the enforcement agencies.”

<p>
WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Tuesday approved the most significant expansion of labor rights since the New Deal, advancing legislation that would neutralize right-to-work laws in 27 states and bolster workers’ ability to organize after years of eroding clout.
</p>
<p>
The bill —
<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842\" title=\"\">
the Protecting the Right to Organize, or PRO, Act
</a>
— would amend decades-old labor law to shield workers seeking to form a union from retribution or firing, strengthen the government’s power to punish employers who violate workers’ rights and outlaw mandatory meetings that employers often use to try to quash an organizing drive.
</p>
<p>
It would also make it harder for companies like Uber and Lyft to classify workers as independent contractors, paving the way for a potentially substantial expansion in the pool of workers eligible to unionize.
</p>
<p>
The measure was all but certain to run into a brick wall of opposition in the Senate, where 60 votes would be needed to advance it past a filibuster and Republicans are broadly opposed. It was expected to pass the House with only a handful of Republican votes. It passed the House 225 to 206, with five Republicans joining Democrats in favor.
</p>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9060665362\" morss_score=\"22.6282887584\">
<p>
Democrats, led by President Biden, have embraced the bill as a centerpiece of their pandemic-era agenda. Longtime allies of organized labor, they believe that strengthening unions will provide both a powerful answer to festering economic and racial inequality and a means of wooing back white working-class voters who abandoned the party for former President Donald J. Trump.
</p>
<p>
“As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of deadly pandemic, an economic crisis and reckoning on race that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone,” Mr. Biden said in a statement on Tuesday. It came just days after the president, an outspoken union advocate, had taken the unusual step of
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/us/politics/amazon-union-alabama-biden.html\" title=\"\">
wading into a battle over unionization at Amazon
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Business groups and most Republicans fiercely oppose the measure, arguing that it is a giveaway to union leaders by Democrats looking for campaign donations. They contend that it would hurt workers, trample on states’ rights and decimate businesses at a time when thousands of small companies have folded because of the economic turmoil surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.
</p>
<p>
The bill is “radical, backward-looking legislation, which will diminish the rights of workers and employers while harming the economy and providing a political gift to labor unions and their special interests,” Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, said during the House’s debate.
</p>
<p>
The vote on the labor bill is one of almost a dozen that House Democrats are plotting this month to push forward a flurry of long-sought liberal priorities on gun safety, gay rights, immigration, voting rights and other issues that would reshape the economy and several aspects of American society. Each faces similarly long odds in the Senate, but Democrats are working to ratchet up pressure on Republicans ahead of the 2022 midterms while pushing conservative Democrats to agree to eliminate the legislative filibuster to achieve lasting policy changes.
</p>
</div>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"30.0\">
<p>
“Heaven forbid we pass something that’s going to help the damn workers in the United States of America,” Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, bellowed across the House floor on Tuesday, addressing Republicans who lined up to oppose the measure. The G.O.P., he said, seemed more interested in tax cuts and moaning about “cancel culture” than helping American pocketbooks.
</p>
<p>
“Stop talking about Dr. Seuss and start working with us on American workers!” he added.
</p>
<p>
Strengthening unions has been the priority of Democrats and some Republicans in Congress for decades, as businesses, the courts and Republican-led states have slowly chipped away at labor protections. Plummeting union participation — just over 10 percent of American workers are in a union today, compared with a high of one-third in the 1950s — combined with stagnation in wages among the working and middle class has catapulted the issue to the top of Democrats’ agenda.
</p>
<p>
Labor rights proponents point to studies suggesting that unions help deliver higher wages regardless of race and gender, as well as safer work environments — issues that have taken on greater resonance with the public during the pandemic and after racial justice protests last year. Public polling suggests support for labor unions is rising, too.
</p>
<p>
“The PRO Act is a civil rights act,” Richard Trumka,
</p>
<p>
The bill would not in itself create unions or alter the right to organize. Rather, it tries to ease the path to unionization by strengthening existing unions, putting in place new protections for workers seeking to band together to negotiate as a bloc and establishing new penalties for employers that set out to bust up such efforts.
</p>
<p>
For example, the measure would deprive employers of some of their most potent tools in stopping an organizing campaign: calling mandatory meetings to dissuade employees from unionizing, as Amazon has done, and permanently replacing striking workers.
</p>
<p>
It would for the first time give real teeth to the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces labor law, allowing federal regulators to impose fines and other meaningful punishments on businesses that violate their workers’ rights. Studies suggest such violations have become widespread because employers face no real consequences for their actions. And wronged workers would get new rights to sue in court if the board declined to prosecute their cases.
</p>
</div>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.91279069767\" morss_score=\"25.8980848153\">
<p>
Importantly, the bill also proposes changing how workers and their employers determine who is eligible to unionize to reflect the proliferation of contract or temporary workers who are doing the same work as full-paid employees. The provision would most likely result in tens of thousands of gig workers or more gaining the ability to organize.
</p>
<p>
The measure has alarmed business owners and their supporters, who fear it could undo decades’ worth of gains that have given them a powerful hand in unionization elections. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, warned lawmakers in
<a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/letters-congress/us-chamber-key-vote-letter-hr-842-the-pro-act\" title=\"\">
a letter opposing the bill
</a>
that it would “eliminate any sense of balance” in federal labor law since it was codified in the New Deal of the 1930s.
</p>
<p>
“At a time when thousands of small businesses are struggling to keep their doors open and employees retained during the Covid pandemic, this bill would force businesses to close permanently and lay off workers,” said Kristen Swearingen, the leader of Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, a group opposed to the bill that represents hundreds of industry organizations.
</p>
<p>
Of particular concern, opponents said, would be the elimination of right-to-work laws in dozens of states that have barred workers from negotiating contracts that require all members of the work force — even those who do not join the union — to pay dues. The state laws have effectively constrained the resources available to unions and helped diminish their political clout.
</p>
<p>
But Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies unions at Washington University in St. Louis, suggested Democrats’ legislation was less drastic than some Republicans were making it out to be.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not as if the United States is going to turn into Sweden any time soon when it comes to worker power,” he said. “This bill still doesn’t alter the fundamental workplace arrangements in any way. What it does is try to honor the letter of the National Labor Relations Act and let workers who want actual representation have a fair shot.”

Plummeting union participation — just over 10 percent of American workers are in a union today, compared with a high of one-third in the 1950s — combined with stagnation in wages among the working and middle class has catapulted the issue to the top of Democrats’ agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Labor rights proponents point to studies suggesting that unions help deliver higher wages regardless of race and gender, as well as safer work environments — issues that have taken on greater resonance with the public during the pandemic and after racial justice protests last year. Public polling suggests support for labor unions is rising, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The PRO Act is a civil rights act,” Richard Trumka,
             </p>
            <p>
             The bill would not in itself create unions or alter the right to organize. Rather, it tries to ease the path to unionization by strengthening existing unions, putting in place new protections for workers seeking to band together to negotiate as a bloc and establishing new penalties for employers that set out to bust up such efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, the measure would deprive employers of some of their most potent tools in stopping an organizing campaign: calling mandatory meetings to dissuade employees from unionizing, as Amazon has done, and permanently replacing striking workers.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would for the first time give real teeth to the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces labor law, allowing federal regulators to impose fines and other meaningful punishments on businesses that violate their workers’ rights. Studies suggest such violations have become widespread because employers face no real consequences for their actions. And wronged workers would get new rights to sue in court if the board declined to prosecute their cases.
            </p>

            <p>
             Importantly, the bill also proposes changing how workers and their employers determine who is eligible to unionize to reflect the proliferation of contract or temporary workers who are doing the same work as full-paid employees. The provision would most likely result in tens of thousands of gig workers or more gaining the ability to organize.
            </p>
            <p>
             The measure has alarmed business owners and their supporters, who fear it could undo decades’ worth of gains that have given them a powerful hand in unionization elections. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, warned lawmakers in
             <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/letters-congress/us-chamber-key-vote-letter-hr-842-the-pro-act\" title=\"\">
              a letter opposing the bill
             </a>
             that it would “eliminate any sense of balance” in federal labor law since it was codified in the New Deal of the 1930s.
            </p>
            <p>
             “At a time when thousands of small businesses are struggling to keep their doors open and employees retained during the Covid pandemic, this bill would force businesses to close permanently and lay off workers,” said Kristen Swearingen, the leader of Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, a group opposed to the bill that represents hundreds of industry organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of particular concern, opponents said, would be the elimination of right-to-work laws in dozens of states that have barred workers from negotiating contracts that require all members of the work force — even those who do not join the union — to pay dues. The state laws have effectively constrained the resources available to unions and helped diminish their political clout.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies unions at Washington University in St. Louis, suggested Democrats’ legislation was less drastic than some Republicans were making it out to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It’s not as if the United States is going to turn into Sweden any time soon when it comes to worker power,” he said. “This bill still doesn’t alter the fundamental workplace arrangements in any way. What it does is try to honor the letter of the National Labor Relations Act and let workers who want actual representation have a fair shot.”

How big are the stimulus payments in the bill, and who is eligible?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
The
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/politics/senate-stimulus-bill.html\" title=\"\">
stimulus
</a>
payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children.
</p>
<p>
To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below.
</p>
<p>
To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number.
</p>
<h2>
Is there a partial payment for higher earners?
</h2>
<p>
Yes. But payments would phase out quickly as adjusted gross income rises.
</p>
<p>
For single filers, the checks decrease to zero at $80,000. For heads of household, the cutoff is $120,000. And for joint filers, the checks stop at $160,000.
</p>
<p>
Payments for children decrease in the same way.
</p>
<h2>
Do college students count as eligible dependents?
</h2>
<p>
College students whom qualifying taxpayers claim as dependents are eligible. (They weren’t for past payments.) The payment would go to the parent taxpayer, not the child.
</p>
<h2>
Do older relatives who live with us count as eligible dependents?
</h2>
<p>
Good news here, too. If claimed as dependents, these relatives are also eligible this time. The payment would go to the qualifying taxpayer, not the dependent adult.
</p>
<h2>
Which year of income determines eligibility?
</h2>
<p>
The most recent year on record at the Internal Revenue Service. If you’ve already filed your taxes this year, it would be 2020. If not, it would be 2019.

<p>
If you’re already receiving unemployment benefits, payments would generally be extended for another 25 weeks, until Sept. 6. The weekly supplemental benefit, which is provided on top of your regular benefit, will remain $300 but run through Sept. 6.
</p>
<p>
Although unemployment benefits are taxable, the new law would make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free for people with incomes of less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only.
</p>
<h2>
If I already filed my 2020 taxes, how do I claim that new tax break?
</h2>
<p>
It’s not yet clear, but you may have to file an amended return, according to a Senate aide. The Internal Revenue Service has not issued formal guidance yet. (But here’s hoping they figure out a way to make it happen automatically.)
</p>
<h2>
How would the benefit extensions work?
</h2>
<p>
The extended payments would continue to be delivered through different federal programs, largely based on the type of work you did and for whom.
</p>
<p>
Benefits through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which covers the self-employed, gig workers, part-timers and others who are typically ineligible for regular unemployment benefits, would be available for a total of 79 weeks, up from 50, and run through Sept. 6.
</p>
<p>
And benefits through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which essentially extends benefits for people who exhaust their regular state benefits, would be available for a total of 53 weeks, up from 24, also lasting through Sept. 6.
</p>
<h2>
What happens to the supplemental payments?
</h2>
<p>
If you qualify for any benefits, you would also receive the full $300 supplemental payment for weeks ending after March 14 and through Sept. 6. Known as F.P.U.C., it’s called the federal pandemic unemployment compensation.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also extend an extra $100 weekly payment, called the mixed-earner supplement, through Sept. 6. This payment helps people who have a mix of income from both self-employment and wages paid by other employers, because they are often stuck with a lower state-issued benefit based on their (lower) wages.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also clarify that the $300 federal supplement would not be counted when calculating eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But the mixed earner supplement would be counted.
</p>
<h2>
Would payments be uninterrupted?
</h2>
<p>
If the bill becomes law, experts said, there may be a gap for beneficiaries in many states because it usually takes a couple of weeks for agencies to program any benefit extensions.

Health Insurance
</p>
<h2>
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/06/business/stimulus-check-plan-details#what-would-the-relief-bill-do-about-health-insurance\">
What would the relief bill do about health insurance?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
Buying insurance through the program known as
<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/cobra\" title=\"\">
COBRA
</a>
would temporarily become a lot cheaper.
</p>
<p>
COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it’s expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium.
</p>
<p>
Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30 for people who have lost a job or had their hours cut.
</p>
<p>
A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either.
</p>
<h2>
Will the cost of health insurance I buy through an exchange be affected?
</h2>
<p>
The bill would lower the cost of health insurance in many instances for people who bought their own health insurance via a government exchange. And the premiums for those plans would cost no more than 8.5 percent of your modified adjusted gross income.
</p>
<p>
These changes would be effective immediately and last through the end of 2022; they would not require people to re-enroll to access the lower prices.
</p>
<h2>
How do I sign up for health insurance?
</h2>
<p>
If you don’t already have health insurance but would want it if the price was right, an
<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/\" title=\"\">
open enrollment period
</a>
is already in effect through May 15. You can also switch plans to try to lower the price you’re paying already or get more generous coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation maintains a
<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/\" title=\"\">
calculator
</a>
that estimates your premiums based on your income and any available government subsidies, and it will be updated once the bill passes.
</p>
<h2>
Are there any changes to health care flexible spending accounts?
</h2>
<p>
None this time, though there were some in the

What would the bill change about the child and dependent care tax credit?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
This credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. “That will be helpful to people at the lower end” of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.
</p>
<h2>
How much would the credit be worth?
</h2>
<p>
The new bill would make the credit worth up to $4,000 for one qualifying individual or $8,000 for two or more. The credit would be calculated by taking up to 50 percent of the value of eligible expenses, up to certain limits, depending on your income. (The more you earn, the lower the percentage you can claim.)
</p>
<p>
Currently, the credit is generally worth between 20 and 35 percent of eligible expenses with a maximum value of $2,100 for two or more qualifying individuals.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also significantly increase the income level at which the credit begins to be reduced. Under current law, that starts at an adjusted gross income of $15,000, but the bill would make the full value of the credit available to households making up to $125,000.
</p>
<p>
Under current law, the credit is not further reduced below 20 percent, regardless of income, Mr. Luscombe said. But the proposed law would begin to reduce the credit below 20 percent for households with income of more than $400,000.
</p>
<p>
These changes would be effective for 2021 only.
</p>
<h2>
What about dependent care flexible spending accounts?
</h2>
<p>
The bill would make one big change. For 2021 — and only for 2021 — you could set aside $10,500 in a dependent care account instead of the normal $5,000. But employers would have to allow the change: You can’t adjust the withholdings from your paycheck yourself if your employer declines to provide the option.

How would the bill change the child tax credit?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
The bill would make the credit more generous for 2021, particularly for low- and middle-income people.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the credit is worth up to $2,000 per eligible
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/child-tax-credit-stimulus.html\" title=\"\">
child
</a>
. The bill would increase it to as much as $3,000 per child ($3,600 for ages 5 and under). It would also raise the age limit for qualifying children to 17, from 16.
</p>
<h2>
Would it change how the credit worked?
</h2>
<p>
Here’s where it gets interesting: You could receive some of the credit as an advance on your 2021 taxes.
</p>
<p>
The bill would make the credit fully refundable, which means you can receive money from it as a tax refund even if your tax bill is reduced to zero. And half of that money could be advanced to households over the next six months (based on their 2020 tax information, or 2019 if that was unavailable). It’s not clear how frequently payments would be made — perhaps monthly — but under the bill they would begin in July.
</p>
<p>
The changes are effective for 2021 only, though at least some Democrats would like to make it permanent.
</p>
<h2>
Who is eligible?
</h2>
<p>
Married couples who have modified adjusted gross income up to $150,000 (or heads of household up to $112,500 and single filers up to $75,000) would receive the full value of the new benefit.
</p>
<p>
But after that, the extra amount above the original $2,000 credit — either $1,000 or $1,600 per child — is reduced by $50 for every $1,000 in modified adjusted gross income that exceeds those levels. (For joint filers with one child age 6 to 17, the extra amount would be phased out at about $170,000.)
</p>
<p>
At that point, the tax credit levels out at $2,000, and is then subject to the current income limits. The $2,000 benefit begins to phase out when married filers have adjusted gross income of $400,000 ($200,000 for singles).
</p>
<h2>
How would the advance payments work?
</h2>
<p>
Should the bill become law, the advance payments would total up to half the value of the credit the household is eligible to receive. (The other half would be claimed on the 2021 return.) But exactly how often the payments would be sent out depends on what the Treasury Department decides is feasible.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how it might work for a couple earning $150,000 or less. With two children, ages 7 and 9, they would be eligible for a $6,000 credit ($3,000 times two). If the payments were made monthly, the family would receive $500 per month starting in July and lasting through the end of the year. The remaining $3,000 would be claimed in 2021 on their tax return.
</p>
</div>
<h2>

Would the bill increase the earned-income tax credit?
</a>
</h2>
<p>
For 2021 only, the bill would increase for childless households the size of
<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/earned-income-and-earned-income-tax-credit-eitc-tables\" title=\"\">
the earned-income tax credit
</a>
, which helps those at the lower end of the income scale, and make more taxpayers eligible.
</p>
<p>
The maximum credit amount for childless people would increase to $1,502, from $543.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also broaden the age range: People without children would be able to claim the credit beginning at age 19 instead of 25, with the exception of certain full-time students. The upper age limit, 65, would be eliminated.
</p>
<h2>
How would separated spouses be affected?
</h2>
<p>
Married but separated people could be treated as not married for the purpose of the credit if they don’t file a joint tax return.
</p>
<p>
This would apply only if the taxpayer lived with a qualifying child for more than half of the taxable year and didn’t have the same principal home as the spouse at least six months of the year. A separation decree or agreement would also suffice, as long as the individual didn’t live with the spouse by the end of the taxable year.
</p>
<p>
This change would be permanent.
</p>
<h2>
Are there any other changes?
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
For the purposes of calculating the credit in the 2021 tax year, taxpayers could choose to use their 2019 income if it was higher than 2021, according to a Senate aide.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
People who otherwise would be eligible but whose children do not have Social Security numbers would be permitted to claim the version of the credit available to childless households. This change would be permanent.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Taxpayers wouldn’t be disqualified for the credit in 2021 until they had investment income of $10,000, up from $3,650. This change would be permanent, with the $10,000 threshold indexed to inflation.

<a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/era_1-pgr_12.20.20.pdf\" title=\"\">
conditions
</a>
. Household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance.
</p>
<h2>
Is there anything for homeowners?
</h2>
<p>
The bill would provide nearly $10 billion to help homeowners struggling with mortgage payments, utility bills and other housing costs.
</p>
<p>
Roughly $100 million would be dedicated to housing counseling, which would help both homeowners and renters remain in their homes.
</p>
<h2>
How about homeless people?
</h2>
<p>
About $5 billion would be allocated to help the homeless, which would help provide socially distant housing, including the conversion of properties like motels into shelters.
<br>
</p>
<p>
Another $5 billion would be used for emergency housing vouchers, which would help several groups of people — from the homeless to people at risk of homelessness, including survivors of domestic violence — find stable housing.

There would be a big one for people who already have debt.
</p>
<p>
You wouldn’t have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you’ve been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if Congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people.
</p>
<p>
This would be the case for debt forgiven between Jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025.

          payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children.
         </p>
         <p>
          To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below.
         </p>
         <p>
          To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number.

         <h2>
          Is there a partial payment for higher earners?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Yes. But payments would phase out quickly as adjusted gross income rises.
         </p>
         <p>
          For single filers, the checks decrease to zero at $80,000. For heads of household, the cutoff is $120,000. And for joint filers, the checks stop at $160,000.
         </p>

          Payments for children decrease in the same way.

          Do college students count as eligible dependents?
         </h2>
         <p>
          College students whom qualifying taxpayers claim as dependents are eligible. (They weren’t for past payments.) The payment would go to the parent taxpayer, not the child.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Do older relatives who live with us count as eligible dependents?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Good news here, too. If claimed as dependents, these relatives are also eligible this time. The payment would go to the qualifying taxpayer, not the dependent adult.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Which year of income determines eligibility?

         <p>
          The most recent year on record at the Internal Revenue Service. If you’ve already filed your taxes this year, it would be 2020. If not, it would be 2019.

         <p>
          If you’re already receiving unemployment benefits, payments would generally be extended for another 25 weeks, until Sept. 6. The weekly supplemental benefit, which is provided on top of your regular benefit, will remain $300 but run through Sept. 6.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although unemployment benefits are taxable, the new law would make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free for people with incomes of less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only.
         </p>
         <h2>
          If I already filed my 2020 taxes, how do I claim that new tax break?
         </h2>
         <p>
          It’s not yet clear, but you may have to file an amended return, according to a Senate aide. The Internal Revenue Service has not issued formal guidance yet. (But here’s hoping they figure out a way to make it happen automatically.)
         </p>
         <h2>
          How would the benefit extensions work?
         </h2>
         <p>
          The extended payments would continue to be delivered through different federal programs, largely based on the type of work you did and for whom.
         </p>
         <p>
          Benefits through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which covers the self-employed, gig workers, part-timers and others who are typically ineligible for regular unemployment benefits, would be available for a total of 79 weeks, up from 50, and run through Sept. 6.
         </p>
         <p>
          And benefits through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which essentially extends benefits for people who exhaust their regular state benefits, would be available for a total of 53 weeks, up from 24, also lasting through Sept. 6.
         </p>
         <h2>
          What happens to the supplemental payments?
         </h2>
         <p>
          If you qualify for any benefits, you would also receive the full $300 supplemental payment for weeks ending after March 14 and through Sept. 6. Known as F.P.U.C., it’s called the federal pandemic unemployment compensation.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill would also extend an extra $100 weekly payment, called the mixed-earner supplement, through Sept. 6. This payment helps people who have a mix of income from both self-employment and wages paid by other employers, because they are often stuck with a lower state-issued benefit based on their (lower) wages.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill would also clarify that the $300 federal supplement would not be counted when calculating eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But the mixed earner supplement would be counted.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Would payments be uninterrupted?
         </h2>
         <p>
          If the bill becomes law, experts said, there may be a gap for beneficiaries in many states because it usually takes a couple of weeks for agencies to program any benefit extensions.

          Buying insurance through the program known as

           COBRA
          </a>
          would temporarily become a lot cheaper.
         </p>
         <p>
          COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it’s expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30 for people who have lost a job or had their hours cut.
         </p>
         <p>
          A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Will the cost of health insurance I buy through an exchange be affected?
         </h2>
         <p>
          The bill would lower the cost of health insurance in many instances for people who bought their own health insurance via a government exchange. And the premiums for those plans would cost no more than 8.5 percent of your modified adjusted gross income.
         </p>
         <p>
          These changes would be effective immediately and last through the end of 2022; they would not require people to re-enroll to access the lower prices.
         </p>
         <h2>
          How do I sign up for health insurance?
         </h2>
         <p>
          If you don’t already have health insurance but would want it if the price was right, an

           open enrollment period
          </a>
          is already in effect through May 15. You can also switch plans to try to lower the price you’re paying already or get more generous coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation maintains a

           calculator
          </a>
          that estimates your premiums based on your income and any available government subsidies, and it will be updated once the bill passes.

          This credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. “That will be helpful to people at the lower end” of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.
         </p>
         <h2>
          How much would the credit be worth?
         </h2>
         <p>
          The new bill would make the credit worth up to $4,000 for one qualifying individual or $8,000 for two or more. The credit would be calculated by taking up to 50 percent of the value of eligible expenses, up to certain limits, depending on your income. (The more you earn, the lower the percentage you can claim.)
         </p>
         <p>
          Currently, the credit is generally worth between 20 and 35 percent of eligible expenses with a maximum value of $2,100 for two or more qualifying individuals.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill would also significantly increase the income level at which the credit begins to be reduced. Under current law, that starts at an adjusted gross income of $15,000, but the bill would make the full value of the credit available to households making up to $125,000.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under current law, the credit is not further reduced below 20 percent, regardless of income, Mr. Luscombe said. But the proposed law would begin to reduce the credit below 20 percent for households with income of more than $400,000.
         </p>
         <p>
          These changes would be effective for 2021 only.
         </p>
         <h2>
          What about dependent care flexible spending accounts?
         </h2>
         <p>
          The bill would make one big change. For 2021 — and only for 2021 — you could set aside $10,500 in a dependent care account instead of the normal $5,000. But employers would have to allow the change: You can’t adjust the withholdings from your paycheck yourself if your employer declines to provide the option.

          The bill would make the credit more generous for 2021, particularly for low- and middle-income people.
         </p>
         <p>
          Currently, the credit is worth up to $2,000 per eligible

           child
          </a>
          . The bill would increase it to as much as $3,000 per child ($3,600 for ages 5 and under). It would also raise the age limit for qualifying children to 17, from 16.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Would it change how the credit worked?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Here’s where it gets interesting: You could receive some of the credit as an advance on your 2021 taxes.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill would make the credit fully refundable, which means you can receive money from it as a tax refund even if your tax bill is reduced to zero. And half of that money could be advanced to households over the next six months (based on their 2020 tax information, or 2019 if that was unavailable). It’s not clear how frequently payments would be made — perhaps monthly — but under the bill they would begin in July.
         </p>
         <p>
          The changes are effective for 2021 only, though at least some Democrats would like to make it permanent.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Who is eligible?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Married couples who have modified adjusted gross income up to $150,000 (or heads of household up to $112,500 and single filers up to $75,000) would receive the full value of the new benefit.
         </p>
         <p>
          But after that, the extra amount above the original $2,000 credit — either $1,000 or $1,600 per child — is reduced by $50 for every $1,000 in modified adjusted gross income that exceeds those levels. (For joint filers with one child age 6 to 17, the extra amount would be phased out at about $170,000.)
         </p>
         <p>
          At that point, the tax credit levels out at $2,000, and is then subject to the current income limits. The $2,000 benefit begins to phase out when married filers have adjusted gross income of $400,000 ($200,000 for singles).
         </p>
         <h2>
          How would the advance payments work?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Should the bill become law, the advance payments would total up to half the value of the credit the household is eligible to receive. (The other half would be claimed on the 2021 return.) But exactly how often the payments would be sent out depends on what the Treasury Department decides is feasible.
         </p>
         <p>
          Here’s how it might work for a couple earning $150,000 or less. With two children, ages 7 and 9, they would be eligible for a $6,000 credit ($3,000 times two). If the payments were made monthly, the family would receive $500 per month starting in July and lasting through the end of the year. The remaining $3,000 would be claimed in 2021 on their tax return.

          , which helps those at the lower end of the income scale, and make more taxpayers eligible.
         </p>
         <p>
          The maximum credit amount for childless people would increase to $1,502, from $543.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill would also broaden the age range: People without children would be able to claim the credit beginning at age 19 instead of 25, with the exception of certain full-time students. The upper age limit, 65, would be eliminated.
         </p>
         <h2>
          How would separated spouses be affected?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Married but separated people could be treated as not married for the purpose of the credit if they don’t file a joint tax return.
         </p>
         <p>
          This would apply only if the taxpayer lived with a qualifying child for more than half of the taxable year and didn’t have the same principal home as the spouse at least six months of the year. A separation decree or agreement would also suffice, as long as the individual didn’t live with the spouse by the end of the taxable year.
         </p>

            For the purposes of calculating the credit in the 2021 tax year, taxpayers could choose to use their 2019 income if it was higher than 2021, according to a Senate aide.

          <li>
           <p>
            People who otherwise would be eligible but whose children do not have Social Security numbers would be permitted to claim the version of the credit available to childless households. This change would be permanent.

          </li>
          <li>
           <p>
            Taxpayers wouldn’t be disqualified for the credit in 2021 until they had investment income of $10,000, up from $3,650. This change would be permanent, with the $10,000 threshold indexed to inflation.

         <p>
          Nearly $22 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. The vast majority of it would replenish the so-called Coronavirus Relief Fund, created by the CARES Act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments,

          To receive financial assistance — which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses — households would have to meet several

Household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance.

<p>
SAN JOSE, Calif. — On an unseasonably warm day in February, two men working with a local community group went door to door in an ethnically diverse neighborhood to persuade people to sign up for Covid-19 vaccinations.
</p>
<p>
It was just after 11 a.m. when they encountered the first person reluctant to get a shot. Two doors down and 30 minutes later, it happened again. For nearly an hour, they stood on a front lawn with George Rodriguez, 67, chatting about the neighborhood, the pandemic and the available vaccines.
</p>
<p>
“I see all this stuff online, about how it’s going to change my DNA. It does something to your DNA, right?” asked Mr. Rodriguez, who is Hispanic. “There is just too much stuff out, too much conflicting information. And then I hear that even if you get the vaccine you can still get sick. Why would I get it, then?”
</p>
<p>
Black and Hispanic communities, which were hit harder by the pandemic and whose vaccination rates are lagging that for white people, are confronting vaccine conspiracy theories, rumors and misleading news reports on social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter and in private online messaging, health authorities and misinformation researchers said.
</p>
<p>
The misinformation varies, like claims that vaccines can alter DNA — which is not true — and that the vaccines don’t work, or that people of color are being used as guinea pigs. A good part of this incorrect information comes from friends, family and celebrities, bubbling up in communities that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and facing other hurdles to getting vaccinated.
</p>
<p>
Foreign news outlets and anti-vaccine activists have also aggressively tried to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines made in the United States and Europe.
</p>
<p>
Misinformation has complicated efforts by some states to reach out to Black and Hispanic residents, particularly when health officials have provided special registration codes for vaccine appointments. Instead of a benefit, in some cases the codes have become the basis for new false narratives.

“What might look like, on the surface, as doctors prioritizing communities of color is being read by some people online as ‘Oh, those doctors want us to go first to be the guinea pigs,’” said Kolina Koltai, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies online conspiracy theories. “I’ve seen people on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Clubhouse — you name it — saying the codes are a way to force the vaccine on communities of color as an experiment.”
</p>
<p>
Research conducted by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation in mid-February
<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/new-analysis-updated-state-data-continues-to-show-wide-disparities-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-by-race-ethnicity/\" title=\"\">
showed
</a>
a striking disparity between racial groups receiving the vaccine in 34 states that reported the data.
</p>
<p>
The state figures vary widely. In Texas, where people who identify as Hispanic make up 42 percent of the population, only 20 percent of the vaccinations had gone to that group. In Mississippi, where Black people make up 38 percent of the population, they received 22 percent of the vaccinations.
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/05/us/vaccine-racial-disparities.html\" title=\"\">
According to an analysis by The New York Times
</a>
, the vaccination rate for Black Americans is half that of white people, and the gap for Hispanic people is even larger.
</p>
<p>
While researchers say a lack of easy access to vaccine sites could be the biggest driver of that shortfall, misinformation is playing a role.
</p>
<p>
The belief that doctors are interested in experimenting on certain communities has deep roots among some groups, Ms. Koltai said. Anti-vaccine activists have drawn on historical examples, including Nazi doctors who ran experiments in concentration camps, and the Baltimore hospital where, 70 years ago, cancer cells were collected from Henrietta Lacks, a Black mother of five,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-henrietta-lacks.html\" title=\"\">
without her consent.
</a>
</p>
<p>
“The thing about misinformation is that it works best when it is built around a kernel of truth. In this case, many communities of color don’t trust the medical establishment because they don’t have the best history with it,” said Shireen Mitchell, founder of

An experiment conducted in 1943 on nearly 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Ala., is one of the most researched examples of medical mistreatment of the Black community. Over four decades, scientists observed the men, whom they knew were infected with syphilis, but didn’t offer treatments so that they could study the disease’s progression. When the experiment came to light in the 1970s, it
<a href=\"https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/news/researchers-and-students-run-pilot-project-oakland-test-whether-tuskegee-syphilis-trial-last\" title=\"\">
was condemned
</a>
by the medical community as a major violation of ethical standards.
</p>
<p>
Researchers who study disinformation followed mentions of Tuskegee on social media over the last year. While Tuskegee averaged several hundred mentions a week on Facebook and Twitter, there were several noticeable spikes that coincided with the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company.

There was another lull until mid-December, when the Food and Drug Administration
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/health/covid-vaccine-fda-moderna.html\" title=\"\">
announced
</a>
it had given emergency approval to the vaccines. Mentions of Tuskegee climbed to nearly 5,000 that week, according to Zignal, with some of the most viral tweets calling the coronavirus vaccines “the New Tuskegee study.”

Doctors say they are battling vaccine hesitancy in other demographic groups, as well. Last month, a poll by the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 23 percent of Republicans said they would “

vaccine fears in their communities, and doctors have reported that some of their Chinese-American patients have been bringing in articles in Chinese-language media outlets questioning vaccines made in the United States.

Many Black and Hispanic people were already struggling to make appointments and reach vaccination sites that are often in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods. And officials in some cities say that people from those neighborhoods also have been

<p>
Misinformation about who is allowed to receive the vaccine, when it is available and how it was safety tested has added even more difficulty, Ms. Mitchell, said.

At a mass vaccination site at the Oakland Coliseum on a recent Friday afternoon, before 68-year-old Anthony Jones agreed to get his shot last month, there was just one last thing he wanted to look up on Facebook. He pulled out his phone and started to tap, waving off his grandson, who had driven him to his appointment.

Providers in the U.S. are administering about 2.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines per day, on average. About 59 million people have received at least one dose, and about 31 million have been fully vaccinated.

In the near future,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/travel/coronavirus-vaccine-passports.html\">
travel may require digital documentation

When can you get the vaccine? What are the vaccine’s side effects? Is it safe to get one during pregnancy?

“I read something about a woman who died from this thing, and I want to know if she was Black,” said Mr. Jones, who after several minutes of scrolling could not find the Facebook post he was looking for. “You see a lot of stuff on the internet which makes you think, as a Black man, you should not be taking this vaccine.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Jones eventually gave up. As he was walking in for his shot he remembered the article he had seen was on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, and from a website he didn’t recognize.
</p>
<p>
“My grandson tells me not to believe everything I read on the internet,” he said. “I like to believe my grandson.”
</p>
<p>
The next day, Daniel Lander, 38, was canvassing a neighborhood in San Jose with Armand Mateos, 28. For the last five months, Mr. Lander has been going door to door in a program managed by Working Partnerships USA, a community organization based in Silicon Valley. The group is working with local county officials to help dispel misinformation about the pandemic and vaccines.
</p>
<p>
“We hear people say that they saw this or that celebrity sharing something on Twitter or Instagram that made them think the vaccine was a bad idea. People value the opinion of people they look up to, and these celebrities have a lot of influence,” Mr. Lander said.
</p>
<p>
As they chatted with Mr. Rodriguez, a muscular man and an enthusiastic talker, Mr. Lander and Mr. Mateos said they sympathized with his concerns. They said they had a lot of the same questions, and explained their decision to get the vaccines themselves. Mr. Rodriguez asked where they got their shots and how it made them feel.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mateos reflexively touched his left arm, where he had received the vaccine in recent weeks. It hurt, he said, and he wasn’t going to sugarcoat it. But he was convinced that it was safe, and that it would keep him and his loved ones from getting sick.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve read all this stuff online, from different news sources, which is confusing. But then they meet me, as someone who has had the shot, and I can give them some real answers,” Mr. Mateos said. He added that many people cited articles in the Spanish-language versions of Russian state-backed media networks,
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/technology/russia-covid-vaccine-disinformation.html\" title=\"\">
Sputnik and Russia Today.
</a>
“They are very down on the American vaccines. People read those stories and don’t want to get the shot.”
</p>
<p>
As the two men were leaving, Mr. Rodriguez yelled out that he would get the shot that week. They made sure he had the phone number and websites he needed to register, and continued down the street.
</p>
<p>
“I think I will get it later this week,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “I don’t make promises, but I think that they’ve convinced me.”

            <p>
             SAN JOSE, Calif. — On an unseasonably warm day in February, two men working with a local community group went door to door in an ethnically diverse neighborhood to persuade people to sign up for Covid-19 vaccinations.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was just after 11 a.m. when they encountered the first person reluctant to get a shot. Two doors down and 30 minutes later, it happened again. For nearly an hour, they stood on a front lawn with George Rodriguez, 67, chatting about the neighborhood, the pandemic and the available vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I see all this stuff online, about how it’s going to change my DNA. It does something to your DNA, right?” asked Mr. Rodriguez, who is Hispanic. “There is just too much stuff out, too much conflicting information. And then I hear that even if you get the vaccine you can still get sick. Why would I get it, then?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Black and Hispanic communities, which were hit harder by the pandemic and whose vaccination rates are lagging that for white people, are confronting vaccine conspiracy theories, rumors and misleading news reports on social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter and in private online messaging, health authorities and misinformation researchers said.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             The misinformation varies, like claims that vaccines can alter DNA — which is not true — and that the vaccines don’t work, or that people of color are being used as guinea pigs. A good part of this incorrect information comes from friends, family and celebrities, bubbling up in communities that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and facing other hurdles to getting vaccinated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Foreign news outlets and anti-vaccine activists have also aggressively tried to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines made in the United States and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Misinformation has complicated efforts by some states to reach out to Black and Hispanic residents, particularly when health officials have provided special registration codes for vaccine appointments. Instead of a benefit, in some cases the codes have become the basis for new false narratives.

             “What might look like, on the surface, as doctors prioritizing communities of color is being read by some people online as ‘Oh, those doctors want us to go first to be the guinea pigs,’” said Kolina Koltai, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies online conspiracy theories. “I’ve seen people on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Clubhouse — you name it — saying the codes are a way to force the vaccine on communities of color as an experiment.”
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             Research conducted by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation in mid-February
             <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/new-analysis-updated-state-data-continues-to-show-wide-disparities-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-by-race-ethnicity/\" title=\"\">
              showed
             </a>
             a striking disparity between racial groups receiving the vaccine in 34 states that reported the data.
            </p>
            
             
              
               
               
               
               
             
            
            <p>
             The state figures vary widely. In Texas, where people who identify as Hispanic make up 42 percent of the population, only 20 percent of the vaccinations had gone to that group. In Mississippi, where Black people make up 38 percent of the population, they received 22 percent of the vaccinations.
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/05/us/vaccine-racial-disparities.html\" title=\"\">
              According to an analysis by The New York Times
             </a>
             , the vaccination rate for Black Americans is half that of white people, and the gap for Hispanic people is even larger.
            </p>
            <p>
             While researchers say a lack of easy access to vaccine sites could be the biggest driver of that shortfall, misinformation is playing a role.
            </p>
            <p>
             The belief that doctors are interested in experimenting on certain communities has deep roots among some groups, Ms. Koltai said. Anti-vaccine activists have drawn on historical examples, including Nazi doctors who ran experiments in concentration camps, and the Baltimore hospital where, 70 years ago, cancer cells were collected from Henrietta Lacks, a Black mother of five,
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-henrietta-lacks.html\" title=\"\">

             “The thing about misinformation is that it works best when it is built around a kernel of truth. In this case, many communities of color don’t trust the medical establishment because they don’t have the best history with it,” said Shireen Mitchell, founder of

             An experiment conducted in 1943 on nearly 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Ala., is one of the most researched examples of medical mistreatment of the Black community. Over four decades, scientists observed the men, whom they knew were infected with syphilis, but didn’t offer treatments so that they could study the disease’s progression. When the experiment came to light in the 1970s, it

             Researchers who study disinformation followed mentions of Tuskegee on social media over the last year. While Tuskegee averaged several hundred mentions a week on Facebook and Twitter, there were several noticeable spikes that coincided with the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company.

             At a mass vaccination site at the Oakland Coliseum on a recent Friday afternoon, before 68-year-old Anthony Jones agreed to get his shot last month, there was just one last thing he wanted to look up on Facebook. He pulled out his phone and started to tap, waving off his grandson, who had driven him to his appointment.

                      Providers in the U.S. are administering about 2.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines per day, on average. About 59 million people have received at least one dose, and about 31 million have been fully vaccinated.

             “I read something about a woman who died from this thing, and I want to know if she was Black,” said Mr. Jones, who after several minutes of scrolling could not find the Facebook post he was looking for. “You see a lot of stuff on the internet which makes you think, as a Black man, you should not be taking this vaccine.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Jones eventually gave up. As he was walking in for his shot he remembered the article he had seen was on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, and from a website he didn’t recognize.
            </p>
            <p>
             “My grandson tells me not to believe everything I read on the internet,” he said. “I like to believe my grandson.”

             The next day, Daniel Lander, 38, was canvassing a neighborhood in San Jose with Armand Mateos, 28. For the last five months, Mr. Lander has been going door to door in a program managed by Working Partnerships USA, a community organization based in Silicon Valley. The group is working with local county officials to help dispel misinformation about the pandemic and vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We hear people say that they saw this or that celebrity sharing something on Twitter or Instagram that made them think the vaccine was a bad idea. People value the opinion of people they look up to, and these celebrities have a lot of influence,” Mr. Lander said.
            </p>
           
           
          
           
            <p>
             As they chatted with Mr. Rodriguez, a muscular man and an enthusiastic talker, Mr. Lander and Mr. Mateos said they sympathized with his concerns. They said they had a lot of the same questions, and explained their decision to get the vaccines themselves. Mr. Rodriguez asked where they got their shots and how it made them feel.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Mateos reflexively touched his left arm, where he had received the vaccine in recent weeks. It hurt, he said, and he wasn’t going to sugarcoat it. But he was convinced that it was safe, and that it would keep him and his loved ones from getting sick.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They’ve read all this stuff online, from different news sources, which is confusing. But then they meet me, as someone who has had the shot, and I can give them some real answers,” Mr. Mateos said. He added that many people cited articles in the Spanish-language versions of Russian state-backed media networks,
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/technology/russia-covid-vaccine-disinformation.html\" title=\"\">
              Sputnik and Russia Today.
             </a>
             “They are very down on the American vaccines. People read those stories and don’t want to get the shot.”
            </p>
            <p>
             As the two men were leaving, Mr. Rodriguez yelled out that he would get the shot that week. They made sure he had the phone number and websites he needed to register, and continued down the street.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I think I will get it later this week,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “I don’t make promises, but I think that they’ve convinced me.”

<p>
New York City’s jails were under such threat from the coronavirus last spring that city officials moved swiftly to let hundreds of people out of the crowded, airless old buildings. The effort shrank the jail population to its lowest point in more than half a century.
</p>
<p>
But it did not last. A year later, jails are more crowded than they were when the pandemic began. And there has been an increase in infections in recent months that could pose a public health risk even beyond the jail walls.
</p>
<p>
There are now more than 5,500 people in the city’s jails, slightly more than were detained last March. About three-quarters of the people being held have not been convicted. Many are awaiting trial much longer than usual, as the court system continues to operate at a near standstill during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
In lawsuits, prisoners and guards alike have called the living conditions inside unsanitary and dangerous. Incarcerated people who were recently held at Rikers Island say that social distancing has again become impossible in some jail units and that soap, sanitation wipes and disinfectants are scarce or unavailable. Many correctional officers, they say, still do not regularly wear face coverings.
</p>
<p>
“They haven’t done anything to keep us safe,” said Prakash Churaman, 21, who was released on bail from Rikers Island on Jan. 19. “Imagine how much bacteria, how much germs there is. It’s basically like we weren’t even human.”
</p>
<p>
Doctors said they feared the uptick of the virus in recent months could set the stage for another major outbreak inside.
</p>
<p>
“The more people in housing areas, the quicker it will spread,” said Dr. Robert Cohen, a member of the city’s Board of Correction, a watchdog agency that monitors jails. “Every week the number of people in jail increases. And in most weeks, the number of people who have been exposed to Covid-19 within the jails increases as well.”
</p>
<p>
Those behind bars are at high risk for contracting and spreading the virus, and correctional facilities

have been home to some of the largest outbreaks nationally
</a>
. Often, those outbreaks have spread into the community at large, as people shuttle in and out of detention. Few of those being detained in New York have
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/nyregion/new-york-vaccine-prisons.html\" title=\"\">
been offered vaccines
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
“When we see the numbers start to rise as they have, it’s a ticking time bomb,” said Seth J. Prins, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. “Inevitably that will spread back into the communities where folks are returning to.”

Data kept by Correctional Health Services, which oversees care in jails, shows that infections and exposures in the jails crept up during January and February to their highest levels since last spring. A Department of Correction spokesman, in a statement, noted that the average test positivity rate in the jails was lower than in the city at large, though experts warn that the virus’s prevalence in jails can be hard to track.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Correction said that there were not widespread or systemic shortages of soap or other sanitary materials, and that staff members are subject to discipline for not wearing masks. The department also pointed to the ruling in a lawsuit filed by E.E. Keenan, a lawyer representing current and recent detainees at Rikers, in which a judge declined to order city jails to improve their hygiene regimens.
</p>
<p>
A spokesman for the city’s law department, Nick Paolucci, said that the claims in the jails staff members’ suit were unsubstantiated.

<p>
Still, public defenders and civil liberties groups have urged a renewed effort to release people from jails.
</p>
<p>
In the earliest months of the pandemic, public defenders and local officials, led by Mayor Bill de Blasio, pushed for city prosecutors and state courts to
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-rikers-island.html\" title=\"\">
release the most vulnerable populations
</a>
from behind bars and introduced an early release program for people being held on a jail sentence of one year or less.
</p>
<p>
By late April, after hundreds were released, the total population dropped below 3,900.
</p>
<p>
But none of the measures that the city took to release people were implemented on a continuing basis and the jails population began to grow anew in the summer.
</p>

<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.60252365931\" morss_score=\"22.7235762909\">
<p>
The population rose as
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/nyregion/new-york-bail-reform.html\" title=\"\">
rollbacks to the state’s bail reform
</a>
law went into effect in July, changes which data from the
<a href=\"https://www.courtinnovation.org/publications/nycjails-covid\" title=\"\">
Center for Court Innovation
</a>
, a criminal justice nonprofit, shows contributed to some of the initial rise.
</p>
<p>
Judges have also set bail and remanded people to pretrial detention in violent felony cases — which are not part of the state bail reform law — at higher rates than before the pandemic, according to a forthcoming report from the center. Alternatives to jail are being used less often. Public defenders said attempts to secure the release of people at high risk for contracting the virus have fallen short in recent months.
</p>
<p>
Arrests for violent offenses, including for charges related to
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/nyregion/nyc-2020-crime-covid.html\" title=\"\">
the city’s increase in gun crime
</a>
, have also contributed to the rise, city officials say. According to the Department of Correction statistics, 12 percent of people detained in jails are there on gun possession charges. Other serious charges, including murder and assault, might also involve a firearm and could mean that the number of those inside on gun-related crimes is higher, officials say.
</p>
<p>
Once people are in jail, they are at the mercy of a court system
<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/nyregion/courts-covid.html\" title=\"\">
operating in slow motion
</a>
. People are spending an average of almost three months more in jail than they did before the pandemic, city data shows.
</p>
<p>
At least 700 people are jailed whose cases would likely have been resolved if not for the pandemic, according to the city. An additional 285 who otherwise would have been discharged to state prison to serve sentences are stuck in city jails, as those transfers are currently suspended, the Department of Correction said.
</p>
<p>
“More people are at risk every day as a result” of the standstills, said Avery Cohen, a mayoral spokeswoman.
</p>
<p>
The conditions inside and fear of contracting the virus have also stoked a mental health crisis, with rates of self-harm rising amid a climate of what one lawyer called “sheer terror.”
</p>
</div>
<div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"29.0\">
<p>
“It doesn’t take a mental health professional to say that if somebody is living 24/7 in complete fear of death, that their mental health is not going to be that sound,” said Mr. Keenan, the lawyer who represented Rikers detainees in a lawsuit against the city over jail conditions. A group of guards have also filed a lawsuit saying that jail policies placed them at risk.
</p>
<p>
Doctors say the court delays have a direct effect on the mental health of those inside.
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty “leaves people feeling less in control and potentially even more hopeless,” said Dr. Bipin Subedi, a co-chief of mental health at Correctional Health Services.
</p>
<p>
For Mr. Churaman, who was transferred to Rikers Island in July after a felony murder conviction was overturned and he awaited a new trial, the time inside was especially difficult.
</p>
<p>
He had spent more than three years at Rikers before his initial trial, and navigated anxiety and depression while behind bars. During the pandemic, the cancellation of most programming and other opportunities for reprieve from his bed and unit — along with his constant worries of falling ill — exacerbated those issues.
</p>
<p>
He and others detained at or recently released from city jails described increasingly unsafe and unsanitary conditions reminiscent of those in the spring.
</p>
<p>
Shawn Dunn, who was released from Rikers Island on Feb. 9 after about four months inside for several minor parole violations, said as the facility’s population rose in the winter, more than 40 people were often living in the same housing dormitory unit as he was.
</p>
<p>
Their beds were laid out 24 to 36 inches apart, he said, and the tables where he ate meals became increasingly congested. He rarely saw those spaces cleaned or disinfected by staff.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Rigodis Appling, a Manhattan public defender, said that because her clients in jails experienced no relief from the pandemic — no time at which they were able to feel fully safe from infection — they were in a state of unrelenting anxiety.
</p>
<p>
“You go to sleep with the mask, you wake up with the mask, and you live with this constant fear,” she said.

             “When we see the numbers start to rise as they have, it’s a ticking time bomb,” said Seth J. Prins, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. “Inevitably that will spread back into the communities where folks are returning to.”

             Data kept by Correctional Health Services, which oversees care in jails, shows that infections and exposures in the jails crept up during January and February to their highest levels since last spring. A Department of Correction spokesman, in a statement, noted that the average test positivity rate in the jails was lower than in the city at large, though experts warn that the virus’s prevalence in jails can be hard to track.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Department of Correction said that there were not widespread or systemic shortages of soap or other sanitary materials, and that staff members are subject to discipline for not wearing masks. The department also pointed to the ruling in a lawsuit filed by E.E. Keenan, a lawyer representing current and recent detainees at Rikers, in which a judge declined to order city jails to improve their hygiene regimens.
            </p>
            <p>
             A spokesman for the city’s law department, Nick Paolucci, said that the claims in the jails staff members’ suit were unsubstantiated.

             Still, public defenders and civil liberties groups have urged a renewed effort to release people from jails.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the earliest months of the pandemic, public defenders and local officials, led by Mayor Bill de Blasio, pushed for city prosecutors and state courts to
             <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-rikers-island.html\" title=\"\">
              release the most vulnerable populations
             </a>
             from behind bars and introduced an early release program for people being held on a jail sentence of one year or less.
            </p>
            <p>
             By late April, after hundreds were released, the total population dropped below 3,900.
            </p>
            <p>
             But none of the measures that the city took to release people were implemented on a continuing basis and the jails population began to grow anew in the summer.

            <p>
             Judges have also set bail and remanded people to pretrial detention in violent felony cases — which are not part of the state bail reform law — at higher rates than before the pandemic, according to a forthcoming report from the center. Alternatives to jail are being used less often. Public defenders said attempts to secure the release of people at high risk for contracting the virus have fallen short in recent months.

             </a>
             , have also contributed to the rise, city officials say. According to the Department of Correction statistics, 12 percent of people detained in jails are there on gun possession charges. Other serious charges, including murder and assault, might also involve a firearm and could mean that the number of those inside on gun-related crimes is higher, officials say.

             Once people are in jail, they are at the mercy of a court system

             . People are spending an average of almost three months more in jail than they did before the pandemic, city data shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             At least 700 people are jailed whose cases would likely have been resolved if not for the pandemic, according to the city. An additional 285 who otherwise would have been discharged to state prison to serve sentences are stuck in city jails, as those transfers are currently suspended, the Department of Correction said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “More people are at risk every day as a result” of the standstills, said Avery Cohen, a mayoral spokeswoman.
            </p>
            <p>
             The conditions inside and fear of contracting the virus have also stoked a mental health crisis, with rates of self-harm rising amid a climate of what one lawyer called “sheer terror.”

             “It doesn’t take a mental health professional to say that if somebody is living 24/7 in complete fear of death, that their mental health is not going to be that sound,” said Mr. Keenan, the lawyer who represented Rikers detainees in a lawsuit against the city over jail conditions. A group of guards have also filed a lawsuit saying that jail policies placed them at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doctors say the court delays have a direct effect on the mental health of those inside.
            </p>
            <p>
             The uncertainty “leaves people feeling less in control and potentially even more hopeless,” said Dr. Bipin Subedi, a co-chief of mental health at Correctional Health Services.
            </p>
            <p>
             For Mr. Churaman, who was transferred to Rikers Island in July after a felony murder conviction was overturned and he awaited a new trial, the time inside was especially difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had spent more than three years at Rikers before his initial trial, and navigated anxiety and depression while behind bars. During the pandemic, the cancellation of most programming and other opportunities for reprieve from his bed and unit — along with his constant worries of falling ill — exacerbated those issues.
            </p>
            <p>
             He and others detained at or recently released from city jails described increasingly unsafe and unsanitary conditions reminiscent of those in the spring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shawn Dunn, who was released from Rikers Island on Feb. 9 after about four months inside for several minor parole violations, said as the facility’s population rose in the winter, more than 40 people were often living in the same housing dormitory unit as he was.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their beds were laid out 24 to 36 inches apart, he said, and the tables where he ate meals became increasingly congested. He rarely saw those spaces cleaned or disinfected by staff.

             Rigodis Appling, a Manhattan public defender, said that because her clients in jails experienced no relief from the pandemic — no time at which they were able to feel fully safe from infection — they were in a state of unrelenting anxiety.
